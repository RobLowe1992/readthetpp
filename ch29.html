An investor that seeks to invoke Article 9.7 (Expropriation and Compensation) with respect to a taxation measure must first refer to the designated authorities of the Party of the investor and the respondent Party, at the time that it gives its notice of intent under Article 9.18 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration), the issue of whether that taxation measure is not an expropriation. If the designated authorities do not agree to consider the issue or, having agreed to consider it, fail to agree that the measure is not an expropriation within a period of six monthsof the referral, the investor may submit its claim to arbitration under Article 9.18 (Submission of a Claim to Arbitration).</p>

<p>9. Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent Singapore from adopting taxation measures no more trade restrictive than necessary to address Singapore’s public policy objectives arising out of its specific constraints of space.</p>

<p>A Party may elect to deny the benefits of Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) with respect to claims challenging a tobacco control measure<a href="#f6ff">[13]</a> of the Party. Such a claim shall not be submitted to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment) if a Party has made such an election. If a Party has not elected to deny benefits with respect to such claims by the time of the submission of such a claim to arbitration under Section B of Chapter 9 (Investment), a Party may elect to deny benefits during the proceedings. For greater certainty, if a Party elects to deny benefits with respect to such claims, any such claim shall be dismissed.</p>

<h4>Article 29.6: Treaty of Waitangi</h4>

<p>1. Provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination against persons of the other Parties or as a disguised restriction on trade in goods, trade in services and investment, nothing in this Agreement shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems necessary to accord more favourable treatment to Maori in respect of matters covered by this Agreement, including in fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi.</p>

<p>2. The Parties agree that the interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement. Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall otherwise apply to this Article. A panel established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only whether any measure referred to in paragraph 1 is inconsistent with a Party’s rights under this Agreement.</p>

<h2>Section B: General Provisions</h2>

<h4>Article 29.7: Disclosure of Information</h4>

<p>Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require a Party to furnish or allow access to information, the disclosure of which would be contrary to its law or would impede law enforcement, or otherwise be contrary to the public interest, or which would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises, public or private.</p>

<h4>Article 29.8: Traditional Knowledge, Traditional Cultural Expressions and Genetic Resources</h4>

<p>Subject to each Party’s international obligations, each Party may establish appropriate measures to respect, preserve and promote traditional knowledge and traditional cultural expressions.</p>

<pre name="16bd" id="16bd">[1] For the purposes of Chapter 17 (State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies), Article XX of GATT 1994 and its interpretative notes are incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, _mutatis mutandis_, only with respect to measures of a Party (including the implementation of measures through the activities of a state-owned enterprise or designated monopoly) affecting the purchase, production or sale of goods, or affecting activities the end result of which is the production of goods.</pre>




<pre name="5784" id="5784">[2] This paragraph is without prejudice to whether a digital product should be classified as a good or service.</pre>




<pre name="5ffd" id="5ffd">[3] For the purposes of Chapter 17 (State-Owned Enterprises and Designated Monopolies), Article XIV of GATS (including its footnotes) is incorporated into and made part of this Agreement, _mutatis mutandis_, only with respect to measures of a Party (including the implementation of measures through the activities of a state-owned enterprise or designated monopoly) affecting the purchase or supply of services, or affecting activities the end result of which is the supply of services.</pre>




<pre name="f5f4" id="f5f4">[4] Without prejudice to the general interpretation of Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 9.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.3 (National Treatment), and Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), the fact that a measure adopted or maintained pursuant to paragraph 1 or 2 differentiates between investors on the basis of residency does not necessarily mean that the measure is inconsistent with Article 9.4 (National Treatment), Article 9.5 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 10.3 (National Treatment), Article 10.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment), Article 11.3 (National Treatment) and Article and Article 11.4 (Most-Favoured-Nation Treatment).</pre>




<pre name="5fc0" id="5fc0">[5] For greater certainty, measures referred to in paragraph 1 or 2 may be non-discriminatory regulatory actions by a Party that are designed and applied to protect legitimate public welfare objectives as referred to in Annex 9-B(3)(b) (Expropriation).</pre>




<pre name="3443" id="3443">[6] The term “restricted assets” in this subparagraph refers only to assets invested in the territory of the restricting Party by an investor of a Party that are restricted from being transferred out of the territory of the restricting Party.</pre>




<pre name="5052" id="5052">[7] For the purposes of this Article, “foreign direct investment” means a type of investment by an investor of a Party in the territory of another Party, through which the investor exercises ownership or control over, or a significant degree of influence on the management of, an enterprise or other direct investment, and tends to be undertaken in order to establish a lasting relationship. For example, ownership of at least 10 per cent of the voting power of an enterprise over a period of at least 12 months generally would be considered foreign direct investment.</pre>




<pre name="013d" id="013d">[8] For the purposes of consultations between the designated authorities of the relevant Parties, the contact point of Japan is the Ministry of Finance.</pre>




<pre name="4f64" id="4f64">[9] This is without prejudice to the methodology used to determine the value of such investment or property under Parties’ respective laws.</pre>




<pre name="2c3d" id="2c3d">[10] This is without prejudice to the methodology used to determine the value of such investment or property under Parties’ respective laws.</pre>




<pre name="dc5f" id="dc5f">[11] The Parties understand that this subparagraph must be interpreted by reference to the footnote to Article XIV(d) of GATS as if the Article was not restricted to services or direct taxes.</pre>




<pre name="390c" id="390c">[12] For greater certainty, this Article does not prejudice: (i) the operation of Article 9.14 (Denial of Benefits); or (ii) a Party’s rights under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) in relation to a tobacco control measure.</pre>




<pre name="f6ff" id="f6ff">[13] A tobacco control measure means a measure of a Party related to the production or consumption of manufactured tobacco products (including products made or derived from tobacco), their distribution, labeling, packaging, advertising, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, or use, as well as enforcement measures, such as inspection, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements. For greater certainty, a measure with respect to tobacco leaf that is not in the possession of a manufacturer of tobacco products or that is not part of a manufactured tobacco product is not a tobacco control measure.</pre>
