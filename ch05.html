<p>(a) encourage cooperation with other Parties regarding significant customs issues that affect goods traded between the Parties; and</p>

<p>(b) endeavour to provide each Party with advance notice of any significant administrative change, modification of a law or regulation, or similar measure related to its laws or regulations that governs importations or exportations, that is likely to substantially affect the operation of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall, in accordance with its law, cooperate with the other Parties through information sharing and other activities as appropriate, to achieve compliance with their respective laws and regulations that pertain to:</p>

<p>(a) the implementation and operation of the provisions of this Agreement governing importations or exportations, including claims for preferential tariff treatment, procedures for making claims for preferential tariff treatment and verification procedures;</p>

<p>(b) the implementation, application and operation of the Customs Valuation Agreement;</p>

<p>(c) restrictions or prohibitions on imports or exports;</p>

<p>(d) investigation and prevention of customs offences, including duty evasion and smuggling; and</p>

<p>(e) other customs matters as the Parties may decide.</p>

<p>3. If a Party has a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity related to its laws or regulations governing importations, it may request that another Party provide specific confidential information that is normally collected in connection with the importation of goods.</p>

<p>4. If a Party makes a request under paragraph 3, it shall:</p>

<p>(a) be in writing;</p>

<p>(b) specify the purpose for which the information is sought; and</p>

<p>(c) identify the requested information with sufficient specificity for the other Party to locate and provide the information.</p>

<p>5. The Party from which the information is requested under paragraph 3 shall, subject to its law and any relevant international agreements to which it is a party, provide a written response containing the requested information.</p>

<p>6. For the purposes of paragraph 3, “a reasonable suspicion of unlawful activity” means a suspicion based on relevant factual information obtained from public or private sources comprising one or more of the following:</p>

<p>(a) historical evidence of non-compliance with laws or regulations that govern importations by an importer or exporter;</p>

<p>(b) historical evidence of non-compliance with laws or regulations that govern importations by a manufacturer, producer or other person involved in the movement of goods from the territory of one Party to the territory of another Party;</p>

<p>(c) historical evidence of non-compliance with laws or regulations that govern importations by some or all of the persons involved in the movement of goods within a specific product sector from the territory of one Party to the territory of another Party; or</p>

<p>(d) other information that the requesting Party and the Party from which the information is requested agree is sufficient in the context of a particular request.</p>

<p>7. Each Party shall endeavour to provide another Party with any other information that would assist that Party to determine whether imports from, or exports to, that Party are in compliance with the receiving Party’s laws or regulations that govern importations, in particular those related to unlawful activities, including smuggling and similar infractions.</p>

<p>8. In order to facilitate trade between the Parties, a Party receiving a request shall endeavour to provide the Party that made the request with technical advice and assistance for the purpose of:</p>

<p>(a) developing and implementing improved best practices and risk management techniques;</p>

<p>(b) facilitating the implementation of international supply chain standards;</p>

<p>(c) simplifying and enhancing procedures for clearing goods through customs in a timely and efficient manner;</p>

<p>(d) developing the technical skill of customs personnel; and</p>

<h4>Article 5.3: Advance Rulings</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall issue, prior to the importation of a good of a Party into its territory, a written advance ruling at the written request of an importer in its territory, or an exporter or producer in the territory of another Party,<a href="#c277">[1]</a> with regard to:<a href="#c28e">[2]</a></p>

<p>(a) tariff classification;</p>

<p>(b) the application of customs valuation criteria for a particular case in accordance with the Customs Valuation Agreement;</p>

<p>(c) whether a good is originating in accordance with Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures); and</p>

<p>(d) such other matters as the Parties may decide.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall issue an advance ruling as expeditiously as possible and in no case later than 150 daysafter it receives a request, provided that the requester has submitted all the information that the receiving Party requires to make the advance ruling. This includes a sample of the good for which the requester is seeking an advance ruling if requested by the receiving Party. In issuing an advance ruling, the Party shall take into account the facts and circumstances that the requester has provided. For greater certainty, a Party may decline to issue an advance ruling if the facts and circumstances forming the basis of the advance ruling are the subject of administrative or judicial review. A Party that declines to issue an advance ruling shall promptly notify the requester in writing, setting out the relevant facts and circumstances and the basis for its decision to decline to issue the advance ruling.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide that its advance rulings shall take effect on the date that they are issued or on another date specified in the ruling, and remain in effect for at least three years, provided that the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling is based remain unchanged. If a Party’s law provides that an advance ruling becomes ineffective after a fixed period of time, that Party shall endeavour to provide procedures that allow the requester to renew the ruling expeditiously before it becomes ineffective, in situations in which the law, facts and circumstances on which the ruling was based remain unchanged.</p>

<p>4. After issuing an advance ruling, the Party may modify or revoke the advance ruling if there is a change in the law, facts or circumstances on which the ruling was based, if the ruling was based on inaccurate or false information, or if the ruling was in error.</p>

<p>5. A Party may apply a modification or revocation in accordance with paragraph 4 after it provides notice of the modification or revocation and the reasons for it.</p>

<p>6. No Party shall apply a revocation or modification retroactively to the detriment of the requester unless the ruling was based on inaccurate or false information provided by the requester.</p>

<p>7. Each Party shall ensure that requesters have access to administrative review of advance rulings.</p>

<p>8. Subject to any confidentiality requirements in its law, each Party shall endeavour to make its advance rulings publicly available including online.</p>

<h4>Article 5.4: Response to Requests for Advice or Information</h4>

<p>On request from an importer in its territory, or an exporter or producer in the territory of another Party, a Party shall expeditiously provide advice or information relevant to the facts contained in the request on:</p>

<p>(a) the requirements for qualifying for quotas, such as tariff rate quotas;</p>

<p>(b) the application of duty drawback, deferral or other types of relief that reduce, refund or waive customs duties;</p>

<p>(c) the eligibility requirements for goods under Article 2.6 (Goods Re-entered after Repair and Alteration);</p>

<p>(d) country of origin marking,if it is a prerequisite for importation; and</p>

<p>(e) other matters as the Parties may decide.</p>

<p>(b) judicial review of the determination.<a href="#a198">[5]</a></p>

<p>2. Each Party shall ensure that an authority that conducts a review under paragraph 1 notifies the parties to the matter in writing of its decision, and the reasons for the decision. A Party may require a request as a condition for providing the reasons for a decision in the review.</p>

<p>(a) endeavour to use international standards with respect to procedures for the release of goods;</p>

<p>(b) make electronic systems accessible to customs users;</p>

<p>(c) employ electronic or automated systems for risk analysis and targeting;</p>

<p>(d) endeavour to implement common standards and elements for import and export data in accordance with the World Customs Organization (WCO) Data Model;</p>

<p>(e) take into account, as appropriate, WCO standards, recommendations, models and methods developed through the WCO or APEC; and</p>

<p>(f) work toward developing a set of common data elements that are drawn from the WCO Data Model and related WCO recommendations as well as guidelines to facilitate government to government electronic sharing of data for purposes of analysing trade flows.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall endeavour toprovide a facility that allows importers and exporters to electronically complete standardised import and export requirements at a single entry point.</p>

<h4>Article 5.7: Express Shipments</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall adopt or maintain expedited customs procedures for express shipments while maintaining appropriate customs control and selection. These procedures shall:</p>

<p>(a) provide for information necessary to release an express shipment to be submitted and processed before the shipment arrives;</p>

<p>(b) allow a single submission of information covering all goods contained in an express shipment, such as a manifest, through, if possible, electronic means;<a href="#9169">[6]</a></p>

<p>(c) to the extent possible, provide for the release of certain goods with a minimum of documentation;</p>

<p>(d) under normal circumstances, provide for express shipments to be released within six hours after submission of the necessary customs documents, provided the shipment has arrived;</p>

<p>(e) apply to shipments of any weight or value recognising that a Party may require formal entry procedures as a condition for release, including declaration and supporting documentation and payment of customs duties, based on the good’s weight or value; and</p>

<p>(f) provide that, under normal circumstances, no customs duties will be assessed on express shipments valued at or below a fixed amount set under the Party’s law.<a href="#182b">[7]</a> Each Party shall review the amount periodically taking into account factors that it may consider relevant such as rates of inflation, effect on trade facilitation, impact on risk management, administrative cost of collecting duties compared to the amount of duties, cost of cross-border trade transactions, impact on SMEs or other factors related to the collection of customs duties.</p>

<p>2. If a Party does not provide the treatment in paragraph 1(a) through (f) to all shipments, that Party shall provide a separate<a href="#c820">[8]</a> and expedited customs procedure that provides that treatment for express shipments.</p>

<h4>Article 5.8: Penalties</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall adopt or maintain measures that allow for the imposition of a penalty by a Party’s customs administration for a breach of its customs laws, regulations or procedural requirements, including those governing tariff classification, customs valuation, country of origin and claims for preferential treatment under this Agreement.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall ensure that a penalty imposed by its customs administration for a breach of a customs law, regulation or procedural requirement is imposed only on the person legally responsible for the breach.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall ensure that the penalty imposedby its customs administration is dependent on the facts and circumstances<a href="#0514">[9]</a> of the case and is commensurate with the degree and severity of the breach.</p>
