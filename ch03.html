<p>and the good satisfies all other applicable requirements of this Chapter.</p>

<h4>Article 3.3: Wholly Obtained or Produced Goods</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide that for the purposes of Article 3.2 (Originating Goods), a good is wholly obtained or produced entirely in the territory of one or more of the Parties if it is:</p>

<p>(j) a good that is:</p>

<p>(i) waste or scrap derived from production there; or</p>

<p>(ii) waste or scrap derived from used goods collected there, provided that those goods are fit only for the recovery of raw materials; and</p>

<p>(k) a good produced there, exclusively from goods referred to in subparagraphs (a) through (j), or from their derivatives.</p>

<h4>Article 3.4: Treatment of Recovered Materials Used in Production of a Remanufactured Good</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that a recovered material derived in the territory of one or more of the Parties is treated as originating when it is used in the production of, and incorporated into, a remanufactured good.</p>

<p>2. For greater certainty:</p>

<p>(a) a remanufactured good is originating only if it satisfies the applicable requirements of Article 3.2 (Originating Goods); and</p>

<p>(b) a recovered material that is not used or incorporated in the production of a remanufactured good is originating only if it satisfies the applicable requirements of Article 3.2 (Originating Goods).</p>

<h4>Article 3.5: Regional Value Content</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that a regional value content requirement specified in this Chapter, including related Annexes, to determine whether a good is originating, is calculated as follows:</p>

<p>a) Focused Value Method: Based on the Value of Specified Non-Originating Materials</p>

<p>RVC = Value of the Good— FVNM x 100</p>

<p>Value of the Good</p>

<p>b) Build-down Method: Based on Value of Non-Originating Materials</p>

<p>RVC = Value of the Good— VNM x 100</p>

<p>Value of the Good</p>

<p>c) Build-up Method: Based on Value of Originating Materials</p>

<p>RVC = VOM x 100</p>

<p>Value of the Good</p>

<p>or</p>

<p>d) Net Cost Method (for Automotive Goods Only)</p>

<p>RVC = NC ‑ VNM x 100</p>

<p>NC</p>

<p>where:</p>

<p><strong>RVC</strong> is the regional value content of a good, expressed as a percentage;</p>

<p><strong>VNM</strong> is the value of non-originating materials,including materials of undetermined origin, used in the production of the good;</p>

<p><strong>NC</strong> is the net cost of the good determined in accordance with Article 3.9 (Net Cost);</p>

<p><strong>FVNM</strong> is the value of non-originating materials, including materials of undetermined origin, specified in the applicable product-specific-rule (PSR) in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) and used in the production of the good. For greater certainty, non-originating materials that are not specified in the applicable PSR in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) are not taken into account for the purpose of determining FVNM; and</p>

<p><strong>VOM</strong> is the value of originating materials used in the production of the good in the territory of one or more of the Parties.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide that all costs considered for the calculation of regional value content are recorded and maintained in conformity with the Generally Accepted Accounting Principles applicable in the territory of a Party where the good is produced.</p>

<h4>Article 3.6: Materials Used in Production</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material undergoes further production such that it satisfies the requirements of this Chapter, the material is treated as originating when determining the originating status of the subsequently produced good, regardless of whether that material was produced by the producer of the good.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide that if a non-originating material is used in the production of a good, the following may be counted as originating content for the purpose of determining whether the good meets a regional value content requirement:</p>

<p>(a) the value of processing of the non-originating materials undertaken in the territory of one or more of the Parties; and</p>

<p>(b) the value of any originating material used in the production of the non-originating material undertaken in the territory of one or more of the Parties.</p>

<h4>Article 3.7: Value of Materials Used in Production</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide that for the purposes of this Chapter, the value of a material is:</p>

<p>(a) for a material imported by the producer of the good, the transaction value of the material at the time of importation, including the costs incurred in the international shipment of the good;</p>

<p>(b) for a material acquired in the territory where the good is produced:</p>

<p>(i) the price paid or payable by the producer in the Party where the producer is located;</p>

<p>(ii) the value as determined for an imported material in subparagraph (a); or</p>

<p>(iii) the earliest ascertainable price paid or payable in the territory of the Party; or</p>

<p>(c) for a material that is self-produced:</p>

<p>(i) all the costs incurred in the production of the material, which includes general expenses; and</p>

<p>(ii) an amount equivalent to the profit added in the normal course of trade, or equal to the profit that is usually reflected in the sale of goods of the same class or kind as the self-produced material that is being valued.</p>

<h4>Article 3.8: Further Adjustments to the Value of Materials</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that for an originating material, the following expenses may be added to the value of the material, if not included under Article 3.7 (Value of Materials Used in Production):</p>

<p>(a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred to transport the material to the location of the producer of the good;</p>

<p>(b) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material, paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and</p>

<p>(c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide that, for a non-originating material or material of undetermined origin, the following expenses may be deducted from the value of the material:</p>

<p>(a) the costs of freight, insurance, packing and all other costs incurred in transporting the material to the location of the producer of the good;</p>

<p>(b) duties, taxes and customs brokerage fees on the material paid in the territory of one or more of the Parties, other than duties and taxes that are waived, refunded, refundable or otherwise recoverable, which include credit against duty or tax paid or payable; and</p>

<p>(c) the cost of waste and spoilage resulting from the use of the material in the production of the good, less the value of reusable scrap or by-product.</p>

<p>3. If the cost or expense listed in paragraph 1 or 2 is unknown or documentary evidence of the amount of the adjustment is not available, then no adjustment is allowed for that particular cost.</p>

<h4>Article 3.9: Net Cost</h4>

<p>1. If Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) specifies a regional value content requirement to determine whether an automotive good of subheading 8407.31 through 8407.34, 8408.20, heading 84.09, heading 87.01 through 87.08 or heading 87.11 is originating, each Party shall provide that the requirement to determine origin of that good based on the Net Cost Method is calculated as set out under Article 3.5 (Regional Value Content).</p>

<p>2. For the purposes of this Article:</p>

<p>(a) <strong>net cost</strong> means total cost minus sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs that are included in the total cost; and</p>

<p>(b) <strong>net cost of the good</strong> means the net cost that can be reasonably allocated to the good, using one of the following methods:</p>

<p>(i) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all automotive goods produced by that producer, subtracting any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs that are included in the total cost of all those goods, and then reasonably allocating the resulting net cost of those goods to the good;</p>

<p>(ii) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to all automotive goods produced by that producer, reasonably allocating the total cost to the good, and then subtracting any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs; royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs that are included in the portion of the total cost allocated to the good; or</p>

<p>(iii) reasonably allocating each cost that forms part of the total cost incurred with respect to the good, so that the aggregate of these costs does not include any sales promotion, marketing and after-sales service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and non-allowable interest costs, provided that the allocation of all those costs is consistent with the provisions regarding the reasonable allocation of costs set out in Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide that, for the purposes of the Net Cost Method for motor vehicles of heading 87.01 through 87.06 or heading 87.11, the calculation may be averaged over the producer’s fiscal year using any one of the following categories, on the basis of all motor vehicles in the category or only those motor vehicles in the category that are exported to the territory of another Party:</p>

<p>(a) the same model line of motor vehicles in the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a Party;</p>

<p>(b) the same class of motor vehicles produced in the same plant in the territory of a Party;</p>

<p>(c) the same model line of motor vehicles produced in the territory of a Party; or</p>

<p>(d) any other category as the Parties may decide.</p>

<p>4. Each Party shall provide that, for the purposes of the Net Cost Method in paragraphs 1 and 2, for automotive materials of subheading 8407.31 through 8407.34, 8408.20, heading 84.09, 87.06, 87.07, or 87.08, produced in the same plant, a calculation may be averaged:</p>

<p>(a) over the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer to whom the good is sold;</p>

<p>(b) over any quarter or month; or</p>

<p>(c) over the fiscal year of the producer of the automotive material,</p>

<p>provided that the good was produced during the fiscal year, quarter or month forming the basis for the calculation, in which:</p>

<p>(i) the average in subparagraph (a) is calculated separately for those goods sold to one or more motor vehicle producers; or</p>

<p>(ii) the average in subparagraph (a) or (b) is calculated separately for those goods that are exported to the territory of another Party.</p>

<p>5. For the purposes of this Article:</p>

Except as provided in Annex 3-C (Exceptions to Article 3.11 (<em>De Minimis</em>)), each Party shall provide that a good that contains non-originating materials that do not satisfy the applicablechange in tariff classification requirement specified in Annex 3-D (Product-Specific Rules of Origin) for the good is nonetheless an originating good if the value of all these materials does not exceed 10 per cent of the value of the good, as defined under Article 3.1 (Definitions), and the good meets all the other applicable requirements of this Chapter.</p>

<p>2. Paragraph 1 applies only when using a non-originating material in the production of another good.</p>

<p>3. If a good described in paragraph 1 is also subject to a regional value content requirement, the value of those non-originating materials shall be included in the value of non-originating materials for the applicable regional value content requirement.</p>

<p>3. If a claim for preferential tariff treatment is based on a certification of origin completed by the exporter or producer and, in response to a request for information by an importing Party under paragraph 1(a), the importer does not provide information to the importing Party or the information provided is not sufficient to support a claim for preferential tariff treatment, the importing Party shall request information from the exporter or producer, under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c) before it may deny the claim for preferential tariff treatment. The importing Party shall complete the verification, including any additional request to the exporter or producer under paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), within the time provided in paragraph 6(e).<a href="#0004">[6]</a></p>

<p>5. If an importing Party has initiated a verification in accordance with paragraph 1(b) or 1(c), it shall inform the importer of the initiation of the verification.</p>

<p>6. For a verification under paragraphs 1(a) through 1(c), the importing Party shall:</p>

<p>(a) ensure that a written request for information, or for documentation to be reviewed during a verification visit, is limited to information and documentation to determine whether the good is originating;</p>

<p>(b) describe the information or documentation in sufficient detail to allow the importer, exporter or producer to identify the information and documentation necessary to respond;</p>

<p>7. If an importing Party makes a verification request under paragraph 1(b), it shall, on request of the Party where the exporter or producer is located and in accordance with the importing Party’s laws and regulations, inform that Party. The Parties concerned shall decide the manner and timing of informing the Party where the exporter or producer is located of the verification request. In addition, on request of the importing Party, the Party where the exporter or producer is located may, as it deems appropriate and in accordance with its laws and regulations, assist with the verification. This assistance may include providing a contact point for the verification, collecting information from the exporter or producer on behalf of the importing Party, or other activities in order that the importing Party may make a determination as to whether the good is originating. The importing Party shall not deny a claim for preferential tariff treatment solely on the ground that the Party where the exporter or producer is located did not provide requested assistance.</p>

<p>8. If an importing Party initiates a verification under paragraph 1(c), it shall, at the time of the request for the visit, inform the Party where the exporter or producer is located and provide the opportunity for the officials of the Party where the exporter or producer is located to accompany them during the visit.</p>

<p>9.

If as a result of the verification the importing Party determines that the good is an originating good, it shall grant preferential tariff treatment to the good and refund any excess duties paid or release any security provided, unless the security also covers other obligations.</p>

<p>12. If verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an importer, exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations relevant to a claim that a good imported into its territory qualifies as an originating good, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment to identical goods imported, exported or produced by that person until that person demonstrates that the identical goods qualify as originating. For the purposes of this paragraph, “identical goods” means goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating.</p>

<p>13. For the purpose of a verification request, it is sufficient for a Party to rely on the contact information of an exporter, producer or importer in a Party provided in a certification of origin.</p>

<p>(d) after receipt of a written notification for a verification visit, the exporter or producer does not provide its written consent in accordance with Article 3.27 (Verification of Origin); or</p>

<p>(e) the importer, exporter or producer fails to comply with the requirements of this Chapter.</p>

<p>3. If an importing Party denies a claim for preferential tariff treatment, it shall issue a determination to the importer that includes the reasons for the determination.</p>

<p>4. A Party shall not reject a claim for preferential tariff treatment for the sole reason that the invoice was issued in a non-Party. If an invoice is issued in a non-Party, a Party shall require that the certification of origin be separate from the invoice.</p>

<h4>Article 3.29: Refunds and Claims for Preferential Tariff Treatment after Importation</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that an importer may apply for preferential tariff treatment and a refund of any excess duties paid for a good if the importer did not make a claim for preferential tariff treatment at the time of importation, provided that the good would have qualified for preferential tariff treatment when it was imported into the territory of the Party.</p>

<p>2. As a condition for preferential tariff treatment under paragraph 1, the importing Party may require that the importer:</p>
