<h4>Article 4.1: Definitions</h4>

<p>For purposes of this Chapter:</p>

<p><strong>textile or apparel good</strong> means a good listed in Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin).</p>

<p><strong>customs offence</strong> means any act committed for the purpose of, or having the effect of, avoiding a Party’s laws or regulations pertaining to the terms of this Agreement governing importations or exportations of textile or apparel goods amongst the Parties, specifically those that violate a customs law or regulation for restrictions or prohibitions on imports or exports, duty evasion, falsification of documents relating to the importation or exportation of goods, fraud or smuggling.</p>

<p><strong>transition period</strong> means the period beginning at entry into force of the Agreement between the Parties concerned until five years after the date on which the importing Party eliminates duties on that good for that exporting Party pursuant to this Agreement.</p>

<h4>Article 4.2: Rules of Origin and Related Matters</h4>

<p>Application of Chapter 4</p>

<p>1. Except as provided in this Chapter, including the Annexes thereto, Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures) applies to textile and apparel goods.</p>

<p><strong>De Minimis</strong></p>

<p>2. A textile or apparel good in Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin) classified outside of Chapters 61 through 63 that is not an originating good because the materials used in the production of the good that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin), shall nonetheless be considered to be an originating good if the total weight of all such materials is not more thanten percent of the total weight of the good.</p>

<p>3. Atextile orapparel good of Chapters 61 through 63 that is not an originating good because the fibers or yarns used in the production of the component of the good that determine the tariff classification of the good that do not undergo an applicable change in tariff classification set out in Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin), shall nonetheless be considered to be an originating good if the total weight of all such fibers or yarns is not more than ten per cent of the total weightof that component.</p>

<p>4. Notwithstanding paragraphs 2 and 3, a good of paragraph 2 containing elastomeric yarn or a good of paragraph 3 containing elastomeric yarn in the component of the good that determines the tariff classification of the good shall be considered to be an originating good only if such yarns are wholly formed in the territory of one or more of the Parties.<a href="#4940">[1]</a> <a href="#6d7d">[2]</a></p>

<p><em>Treatment of Sets</em></p>

<p>5. Notwithstanding the textile and apparel specific rules of origin set out in Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin), textile and apparel goods classifiable as goods put up in sets for retail sale as provided for in Rule 3 of the General Rules for the Interpretation of the Harmonized System shall not be regarded as originating goods unless each of the goods in the set is an originating good or the total value of the non-originating goods in the set does not exceed 10 percent of the value of the set.</p>

<p>6. For the purposes of paragraph 5:</p>

<p>a) the value of non-originating goods in the set is calculated in the same manner as the value of non-originating materials in Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures) and</p>

<p>b) the value of the set is calculated in the same manner as the value of the good in Chapter 3 (Rules of Origin and Origin Procedures).</p>

<p><em>Treatment of Short Supply List</em></p>

<p>7. Each Party shall provide that, for purposes of determining whether a good is originating under Chapter 3, Article 2(c), a material listed in Appendix 1 (Short Supply List) to Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin)is originating provided the material meets any requirement, including any end use requirement, specified in the Appendix 1 (Short Supply List) to Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin).</p>

<p>8. Where a claim that a good is originating relies on incorporation of a material on Appendix 1 (Short Supply List) to Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin), the importing Party may require in the importation documentation<strong>,</strong> such as a certification of origin,the number or description of the material on Appendix 1 (Short Supply List) to Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin).</p>

<p>9. Non-originating materials marked as temporary in Appendix 1 (Short Supply List) to Annex A (Textiles and Apparel Product — Specific Rules of Origin) may be considered as originating under paragraph 7 for 5 years from entry into force of this Agreement.</p>

<p><em>Treatment for Certain Handmade or Folkloric Goods</em></p>

<p>10. An importing Party may identify particular textile or apparel goods of an exporting Party to be eligible for duty-free or preferential tariff treatment that the importing and exporting Parties mutually agree fall within:</p>

<p>(a) hand-loomed fabrics of a cottage industry;</p>

<p>(b) hand-printed fabrics with a pattern created with a wax-resistance technique;</p>

<p>(c) hand-made cottage industry goods made of such hand-loomed or hand-printed fabrics; or</p>

<p>(d) traditional folklore handicraft goods</p>

<p>provided that any requirements agreed by the importing and exporting Parties for such treatment are met.</p>

<h4>Article 4.3: Emergency Actions</h4>

<p>1. Subject to the provisions of this Articleif, as a result of the reduction or elimination of a customsduty provided for in this Agreement, a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement is being imported into the territory of a Party in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the domestic market for that good, and under such conditions as to cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic industry producing a like or directly competitive good, the importing Party may, to the extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such damage and to facilitate adjustment, take emergency action in accordance with paragraph 6, consisting of an increase in the rate of duty on the good of the exporting Party or Parties to a level not to exceed the lesser of:</p>

<p>(a) the most-favoured-nation (MFN) applied rate of customsduty in effect at the time the action is taken; and</p>

<p>(b) the MFN applied rate of customsduty in effect on the day immediately preceding the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party.</p>

<p>2. Nothing in this article shall be construed to limit a Party’s rights and obligations underArticle XIX of the GATT 1994, the WTO Agreement on Safeguards, or Chapter 6 (Trade Remedies).</p>

<p>3. In determining serious damage, or actual threat thereof, the importing Party:</p>

<p>(a) shall examine the effect of increased imports from the exporting Party or Parties of a textile or apparel good benefiting from preferential tariff treatment under this Agreement on the particular industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant economic variables as output, productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and investment, none of which either alone or combined with other factors, shall necessarily be decisive; and</p>

<p>(b) shall not consider changes in technology or consumer preference in the importing Party as factors supporting a determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof.</p>

<p>4. The importing Party may take an emergency action under this Article only following its publication of procedures ‎that identify the criteria for a finding of serious damage and only following an investigation by its competent authorities. Such an investigation must use data based on the factors described in 3(a) that serious damage or actual threat thereof is demonstrably caused by increased imports of the product concerned as a result of this Agreement.</p>

<p>5. The importing Party shall submit to the exporting Party or Parties, without delay, written notice of the initiation of the investigation provided for in paragraph 4, as well as of its intent to take emergency action, and, on the request of the exporting Party or Parties, shall enter into consultations with that Party or Parties regarding the matter. The importing Party shall provide the exporting party full details of the emergency action to be taken. The Parties concerned shall begin consultations without delay and, unless otherwise decided, shall complete them within 60 days of receipt of the request. After completion of the consultations, the importing Party shall notify the exporting Party of any decision. If it decides to apply a safeguard measure, the notification shall include the details of the measure, including when it will take effect.</p>

<p>6. The following conditions and limitations shall apply to any emergency action taken under this Article:</p>

<p>(a) no emergency action may be maintained for a period exceeding two yearswith a possible extension for an additional two years;</p>

<p>(b) no emergency action against a good may be taken or maintained beyond the transition period;</p>

<p>(c) no emergency action may be taken by an importing Party against any particular good ofanother Party or Parties more than once; and</p>

<p>(d) on termination of the emergency action, the importing Party shall accord to the good that was subject to the emergency action the tariff treatment that would have been in effect but for the action.</p>

<p>7. The Party taking an emergency action under this Article shall provide to the exporting Party or Parties against whose goods the measure is taken mutually agreed trade liberalizing compensation in the form of concessions having substantially equivalent trade effects or equivalent to the value of the additional duties expected to result from the emergency action. Such concessions shall be limited to textile and apparel goods, unless the Parties concerned otherwise agree. If the Parties concerned are unable to agree on compensation within 60 days or a longer period agreed by the Parties concerned, the Party or Parties against whose good the emergency action is taken may take tariff action having trade effects substantially equivalent to the trade effects of the emergency action taken under this Article. Such tariff action may be taken against any goods of the Party taking the emergency action. The Party taking the tariff action shall apply the tariff action only for the minimum period necessary to achieve the substantially equivalent trade effects. The importing Party’s obligation to provide trade compensation and the exporting Party’s right to take tariff action shall terminate when the emergency action terminates.</p>

<p>8. A Party may not take or maintain an emergency action under this Article against a textile or apparel good that is subject, or becomes subject, to a transitional safeguard measure under Chapter 6 (Trade Remedies), or a safeguard measure that a Party takes pursuant to Article XIX of the GATT 1994, or the WTO Agreement on Safeguards.</p>

<p>9. The investigations referred to in this Article shall be carried out according to procedures established by each Party. Each Party shall, upon entry into force of this Agreement or before it initiates an investigation, notify the other Parties of these procedures.</p>

<p>10. Each Party shall, in any year where it takes or maintains an emergency action under this Article, provide a report on such actions to the other Parties.</p>

<p>13. Where verifications of identical goods by a Party indicate a pattern of conduct by an exporter or producer of false or unsupported representations that a good imported into its territory qualifies for preferential tariff treatment, the Party may withhold preferential tariff treatment for identical textile or apparel goods imported, exported or produced by such a person until it is demonstrated to the importing Party that the identical goods qualify for preferential tariff treatment. For the purpose of this paragraph, identical goods means goods that are the same in all respects relevant to the particular rule of origin that qualifies the goods as originating.</p>
