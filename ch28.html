<h4>Article 28.15: Suspension or Termination of Proceedings</h4>

<p>1. The panel may suspend its work at any time at the request of the complaining Party or, if there is more than one complaining Party, at the joint request of the complaining Parties for a period not to exceed 12 consecutive months. The panel shall suspend its work at any time if the disputing Parties so request. In the event of such a suspension, all relevant time-frames set out in this Chapter and in the Rules of Procedure shall be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If the work of the panel has been suspended for more than 12 consecutive months, the authority for establishment of the panel shall lapse unless the disputing Parties agree otherwise.</p>

<p>2. The panel shall terminate its proceedings where the disputing Parties jointly request it to do so.</p>

<h4>Article 28.16: Initial Report</h4>

<p>1. The report of the panel shall be drafted without the presence of any Party.</p>

<p>2. The panel shall base its report on the relevant provisions of this Agreement, the submissions and arguments of the disputing Parties and any third Parties, and on any information or advice put before it pursuant to Article 28.14 (Role of Experts). At the joint request of the disputing Parties, the panel may make recommendations for the resolution of the dispute.</p>

<p>3. The panel shall present to the disputing Parties an initial report within 150 days after the last panellist is appointed. In cases of urgency, including those related to perishable goods, the panel shall endeavour to do so within 120 days after the last panellist is appointed.</p>

<p>4. The initial report shall contain:</p>

<p>(a) findings of fact;</p>

<p>(b) the determination of the panel as to whether:</p>

<p>(i) the measure at issue is inconsistent with the obligations under this Agreement;</p>

<p>(ii) a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement; or</p>

<p>(iii) a disputing Party’s measure is causing nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 28.3(c) (Scope);</p>

<p>(c) any other determination requested in the terms of reference;</p>

<p>(d) recommendations, if the disputing Parties have jointly requested them, for resolution of the dispute; and</p>

<p>(e) the reasons for the findings and determinations.</p>

<p>5. In exceptional cases, if the panel considers it cannot release its initial report within 150 days, or within 120 days in cases of urgency, it shall inform the disputing Parties in writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period within which it will issue its report. Any delay shall not exceed a further period of 30 days unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree.</p>

<p>6. Panellists may furnish separate opinions on matters not unanimously agreed.</p>

<p>7. A disputing Party may submit written comments to the panel on its initial report within 15 days of the presentation of the report or within such other period as the disputing Parties may agree.</p>

<p>8. After considering any written comments by the disputing Parties on the initial report, the panel may modify its report and make any further examination it considers appropriate.</p>

<h4>Article 28.17: Final Report</h4>

<p>1. The panel shall present a final report to the disputing Parties, including any separate opinions on matters not unanimously agreed, within 30 days of presentation of the initial report, unless the disputing Parties otherwise agree. The disputing Parties shall release the final report to the public within 15 days thereafter, subject to the protection of confidential information.</p>

<p>2. No panel may, either in its initial report or its final report, disclose which panellists are associated with majority or minority opinions.</p>

<h4>Article 28.18: Implementation of Final Report</h4>

<p>1. The Parties recognize the importance of prompt compliance with determinations made by panels under Article 28.17 (Final Report) in achieving the aim of the dispute settlement procedures of this chapter, which is to secure a positive solution to disputes</p>

<p>2. If in its final report the panel determines that:</p>

<p>(a) a measure at issue is inconsistent with a Party’s obligations under this Agreement;</p>

<p>(b) a Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement; or</p>

<p>(c) a Party’s measure is causing nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 28.3(c) (Scope);</p>

<p>the responding Party shall, whenever possible, eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.</p>

<p>3. Unless the disputing Parties decide otherwise, the responding Party shall have a reasonable period of time in which to eliminate the non-conformity or nullification or impairment if it is not practicable to comply immediately.</p>

<p>4. The disputing Parties shall endeavour to agree on the reasonable period of time. Where the disputing Parties fail to agree on the reasonable period of time within 45 days of the presentation of the panel’s report under Article 28.17.1 (Final Report), any disputing Party may, within 60 days of the presentation of the panel’s report under Article 28.17.1 (Final Report), refer the matter to the panel chair to determine the reasonable period of time through arbitration.</p>

<p>5. The panel chair shall take into consideration as a guideline that the reasonable period of time should not exceed 15 months from the presentation of the panel’s final report to the disputing Parties under Article 28.17.1 (Final Report). However, that time may be shorter or longer, depending upon the particular circumstances.</p>

<p>6. The panel chair shall determine the reasonable period of time within 90 days of the date of referral to the panel chair pursuant to subparagraph 4.</p>

<p>7. The disputing Parties may agree to vary the procedures set out in paragraphs 4 to 6 of this article for the determination of the reasonable period of time.</p>

<h4>Article 28.19: Non-Implementation — Compensation and Suspension of Benefits</h4>

<p>1. The responding Party shall, if so requested by the complaining Party or Parties, enter into negotiations with the complaining Party or Parties within 15 days of receipt of such request, with a view to developing mutually acceptable compensation, in circumstances where:</p>

<p>a) the responding Party has notified the complaining Party or Parties that it does not intend to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment; or</p>

<p>b) following the expiry of the reasonable period of time established in accordance with Article 28.18 (Implementation of Final Report), there is disagreement between the disputing Parties as to whether the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment;</p>

<p>2. A complaining Party may suspend benefits in accordance with paragraph 2_bis_ if that complaining Party and the responding Party have:</p>

<p>(a) been unable to agree on compensation within 30 days after the period for developing such compensation has begun; or</p>

<p>(b) agreed on compensation but the relevant complaining Party considers that the responding Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement.</p>

<p><em>2bis</em>. A complaining Party may, at any time after the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met in relation to that complaining Party, provide written notice to the responding Party that it intends to suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend. <a href="#6782">[2]</a> The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the panel issues its determination under paragraph 5, as the case may be.</p>

<p>3. Compensation and the suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall be temporary measures. None of these measures is preferred to full implementation through elimination of the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. Compensation, and suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall only be applied until such time as the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.</p>

<p>4. In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2, the complaining Party shall apply the following principles and procedures:</p>

<p>(a) it should first seek to suspend benefits in the same subject matter as that in which the panel has determined non-conformity or nullification or impairment to exist;</p>

<p>(b) if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same subject matter and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may suspend benefits in a different subject matter. The communication pursuant to paragraph 2 in which it announces such a decision shall indicate the reasons on which it is based; and</p>

<p>(c) in applying the principles set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b), the complaining Party shall take into account:</p>

<p>(i) the trade in the good, the supply of the service or other subject matter in which the panel has found the non-conformity or nullification or impairment, and the importance of such trade to that Party;</p>

<p>(ii) that goods, all financial services covered under Chapter 11 (Financial Services), services other than such financial services and each section in Chapter 18 (Intellectual Property), are each distinct subject matters; and</p>

<p>(iii) the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of benefits.</p>

<p>5. If the responding Party considers that:</p>

<p>(a) the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive or the complaining Party has failed to follow the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4; or</p>

<p>(b) it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has determined to exist;</p>

<p>it may, within 30 days after the complaining Party provides notice under paragraph 2, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter. The responding Party shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party. The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after delivery of the request and shall present its determination to the disputing Parties within 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under subparagraph (a) or (b), or within 120 days for a request under subparagraphs (a) and (b). If the panel determines that the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect.</p>

<p>6. Unless the panel has determined that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 5 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2_bis_. If the panel determines that the complaining Party has not followed the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4, the panel shall set out in its award the extent to which the complaining Party may suspend benefits in which subject matter in order to ensure full compliance with the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4. The complaining Party may suspend benefits only in a manner consistent with the panellist’s award.</p>

<p>7. The complaining Party may not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the p is reconvened under paragraph 5, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the responding Party provides written notice to the complaining Party that it will pay a monetary assessment. The disputing Parties shall consult, beginning no later than ten days after the responding Party, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin and are not engaged in discussions regarding the use of a fund under paragraph 8, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 percent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 5 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 percent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2.</p>

<p>8. If a monetary assessment is to be paid to the complaining Party, then it shall be paid in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties in equal, quarterly installments beginning 60 days after the responding Party gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment. Where the circumstances warrant, the disputing Parties may decide that an assessment shall be paid into a fund designated by the disputing Parties for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting carrying out its obligations under this Agreement.</p>

<p>9. At the same time as the payment of its first quarterly installment, the responding Party shall provide to the complaining Party a plan of the steps it intends to take to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.</p>

<p>10. A responding Party may pay a monetary assessment in lieu of suspension of benefits for a maximum of 12 months from the date on which it has provided written notice under paragraph 7 unless the complaining Party agrees to an extension.</p>

<p>11. A responding Party seeking an extension shall make a written request no later than 30 days before the expiration of the 12 month period. The disputing Parties shall determine the length and terms of any extension, including the amount of the assessment.</p>

<p>12. The complaining Party may suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits in accordance with paragraph 6, if:</p>

<p>(a) the responding Party fails to make a payment or fails to make the payment under paragraph 13 after electing to do so;</p>

<p>(b) the responding Party fails to provide the plan as required under paragraph 9; or</p>

<p>(c) the monetary assessment period, including any extension, has elapsed and the responding Party has not yet eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.</p>

<p>13. If the responding Party notified the complaining Party under paragraph 7 regarding the possible use of a fund and the disputing Parties have not agreed on the use of a fund within 3 months of the date of the responding Party’s notice, and this time period has not been extended by agreement of the disputing Parties, the responding Party may elect to make the monetary assessment payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount determined under paragraph 5. If this election is made the payment must be made within nine months of the responding Party’s notice under paragraph 7 in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties. If the election is not made, the complaining Party may suspend the application of benefits in the amount determined under paragraph 5 at the end of the election period.</p>

<p>14. The complaining Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the notice by the responding Party regarding the possible use of the fund referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13.</p>

<h4>Article 28.20: Compliance Review</h4>

<p>1. Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 28.19 (Non-Implementation — Compensation and Suspension of Benefits), if the responding Party considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment found by the panel, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing written notice to the complaining Party or Parties. The panel shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the responding Party provides notice.</p>

<p>2. If the panel decides that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party or Parties shall promptly reinstate any benefits suspended under Article 28.19 (Non-Implementation — Compensation and Suspension of Benefits).</p>

<h2>Section B: Domestic Proceedings and Private Commercial Dispute Settlement</h2>

<h4>Article 28.21: Private Rights</h4>

<p>No Party may provide for a right of action under its domestic law against any other Party on the ground that a measure of the other Party is inconsistent with its obligations under this Agreement, or that the other Party has otherwise failed to carry out its obligations under this Agreement.</p>

<h4>Article 28.22: Alternative Dispute Resolution</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage and facilitate the use of arbitration and other means of alternative dispute resolution for the settlement of international commercial disputes between private parties in the free trade area.</p>

<p>2. To this end, each Party shall provide appropriate procedures to ensure observance of agreements to arbitrate and for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in such disputes.</p>

<p>3. A Party shall be deemed to be in compliance with paragraph 2 if it is a party to and is in compliance with the 1958 <em>United Nations Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards</em>.</p>

<pre name="e75a" id="e75a">[1] Parties shall, in the case of proposed measures, make every effort to make any request under this provision within 60 days of the publication of the proposed measure, without prejudice to the right to make such requests at any time</pre>




<pre name="6782" id="6782">[2] For greater certainty, the phrase “the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend” refers to the level of concessions under this Agreement the suspension of which a complaining Party considers will have an effect equivalent to that of the non-conformity, or nullification or impairment in the sense of Article 28.3(c) (Scope), determined to exist by the panel in its final report issued under Article 28.17.1 (Final Report).</pre>
