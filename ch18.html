<h4>Article 18.2: Objectives</h4>

<p>The protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights should contribute to the promotion of technological innovation and to the transfer and dissemination of technology, to the mutual advantage of producers and users of technological knowledge and in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare, and to a balance of rights and obligations.</p>

<h4>Article 18.3: Principles</h4>

<p>1. A Party may, in formulating or amending its laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health and nutrition, and to promote the public interest in sectors of vital importance to their socio-economic and technological development, provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter.</p>

<p>2. Appropriate measures, provided that they are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter, may be needed to prevent the abuse of intellectual property rights by right holders or the resort to practices which unreasonably restrain trade or adversely affect the international transfer of technology.</p>

<h4>Article 18.4: Understandings in Respect of this Chapter</h4>

<p>Having regard to the underlying public policy objectives of national systems, the Parties recognise the need to:</p>

<p>(a) promote innovation and creativity;</p>

<p>(b) facilitate the diffusion of information, knowledge, technology, culture and the arts; and</p>

<h4>Article 18.6: Understandings Regarding Certain Public Health Measures</h4>

<p>1. The Parties affirm their commitment to the Declaration on TRIPS and Public Health. In particular, the Parties have reached the following understandings regarding this Chapter:</p>

<p>(a) The obligations of this Chapter do not and should not prevent a Party from taking measures to protect public health. Accordingly, while reiterating their commitment to this Chapter, the Parties affirm that this Chapter can and should be interpreted and implemented in a manner supportive of each Party’s right to protect public health and, in particular, to promote access to medicines for all. Each Party has the right to determine what constitutes a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency, it being understood that public health crises, including those relating to HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other epidemics, can represent a national emergency or other circumstances of extreme urgency.</p>

<p>(b) In recognition of the commitment to access to medicines that are supplied in accordance with the Decision of the General Council of August 30, 2003 on the <em>Implementation of Paragraph Six of the Doha Declaration on the TRIPS Agreement and Public Health</em> (WT/L/540) and the WTO General Council Chairman’s Statement Accompanying the Decision (JOB(03)/177, WT/GC/M/82), as well as the Decision of the WTO General Council of December 6, 2005 on the <em>Amendment of the TRIPS Agreement</em>, (WT/L/641) and the WTO General Council Chairperson’s Statement Accompanying the Decision (JOB(05)319 and Corr. 1,WT/GC/M/100) (collectively, the “TRIPS/health solution”), this Chapter does not and should not prevent the effective utilisation of the TRIPS/health solution.</p>

<p>(c) With respect to the aforementioned matters, if any waiver of any provision of the TRIPS Agreement, or any amendment of the TRIPS Agreement, enters into force with respect to the Parties, and a Party’s application of a measure in conformity with that waiver or amendment is contrary to the obligations of this Chapter, the Parties shall immediately consult in order to adapt this Chapter as appropriate in the light of the waiver or amendment.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall notify, if it has not already done so, the WTO of its acceptance of the <em>Protocol amending the TRIPS Agreement,</em> done at Geneva on December 6, 2005.</p>

<h4>Article 18.8: National Treatment</h4>

<p>1. In respect of all categories of intellectual property covered in this Chapter,<a href="#71c9">[3]</a> each Party shall accord to nationals of another Party treatment no less favourable than it accords to its own nationals with regard to the protection<a href="#2acd">[4]</a> of intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>2. With respect to secondary uses of phonograms by means of analog communications and free over-the-air broadcasting and other non-interactive communications to the public, however, a Party may limit the rights of the performers and producers of another Party to the rights its persons are accorded within the jurisdiction of that other Party.</p>

<p>3. A Party may derogate from paragraph 1 in relation to its judicial and administrative procedures, including requiring a national of another Party to designate an address for service of process in its territory, or to appoint an agent in its territory, provided that such derogation is:</p>

<p>(a) necessary to secure compliance with laws or regulations that are not inconsistent with this Chapter; and</p>

<p>(b) not applied in a manner that would constitute a disguised restriction on trade<em>.</em></p>

<p>4. Paragraph 1 does not apply to procedures provided in multilateral agreements concluded under the auspices of WIPO relating to the acquisition or maintenance of intellectual property rights.</p>

A Party may require a concise and accurate description, or graphical representation, or both, as applicable, of the trademark.</p>

<h4>Article 18.19: Collective and Certification Marks</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide that trademarks include collective marks and certification marks.

In the case of the use of an identical sign for identical goods or services, a likelihood of confusion shall be presumed.</p>

<h4>Article 18.21: Exceptions</h4>

<p>A Party may provide limited exceptions to the rights conferred by a trademark, such as fair use of descriptive terms, provided that those exceptions take account of the legitimate interest of the owner of the trademark and of third parties.</p>

<h4>Article 18.22: Well-Known Trademarks</h4>

<p>1. No Party shall require as a condition for determining that a trademark is well-known that the trademark has been registered in the Party or in another jurisdiction, included on a list of well-known trademarks, or given prior recognition as a well-known trademark.</p>

<p>2. Article 6_bis<em> of the Paris Convention shall apply, </em>mutatis mutandis,_ to goods or services that are not identical or similar to those identified by a well-known trademark,<a href="#7281">[13]</a> whether registered or not, provided that use of that trademark in relation to those goods or services would indicate a connection between those goods or services and the owner of the trademark, and provided that the interests of the owner of the trademark are likely to be damaged by such use.</p>

<p>3. Each Party recognises the importance of the <em>Joint Recommendation Concerning Provisions on the Protection of Well-Known Marks</em> asadopted by the Assembly of the Paris Union for the Protection of IndustrialProperty and the General Assembly of WIPO at the Thirty-Fourth Series of Meetings of the Assemblies of the Member States of WIPO September 20 to 29, 1999.</p>

<p>4. Each Party shall provide for appropriate measures to refuse the application or cancel the registration and prohibit the use of a trademark that is identical or similar to a well-known trademark,<a href="#1382">[14]</a> for identical or similar goods or services, if the use of that trademark is likely to cause confusion with the prior well-known trademark. A Party may also provide such measures including in cases in which the subsequent trademark is likely to deceive.</p>

<h4>Article 18.23: Procedural Aspects of Examination, Opposition and Cancellation</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide a system for the examination and registration of trademarks which includes among other things:</p>

<p>(a) communicating to the applicant in writing, which may be by electronic means, the reasons for any refusal to register a trademark;</p>

<p>(b) providing the applicant with an opportunity to respond to communications from the competent authorities, to contest any initial refusal, and to make a judicial appeal of any final refusal to register a trademark;</p>

<p>(c) providing an opportunity to oppose the registration of a trademark or to seek cancellation<a href="#7dd7">[15]</a> of a trademark; and</p>

<p>(d) requiring administrative decisions in opposition and cancellation proceedings to be reasoned and in writing, which may be provided by electronic means.</p>

<h4>Article 18.24: Electronic Trademarks System</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide:</p>

<p>(a) a system for the electronic application for, and maintenance of, trademarks; and</p>

<p>(b) a publicly available electronic information system, including an online database, of trademark applications and of registered trademarks.</p>

<p>Each Party shall adopt or maintain a trademark classification system that is consistent with the <em>Nice Agreement Concerning the International Classification</em> <em>of Goods and Services for the Purposes of the Registration of Marks,</em> done at Nice, June 15, 1957, as revised and amended (Nice Classification). Each Party shall provide that:</p>

<p>(a) registrations and the publications of applications indicate the goods and services by their names, grouped according to the classes established by the Nice Classification;<a href="#4643">[16]</a> and</p>

<p>(b) goods or services may not be considered as being similar to each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified in the same class of the Nice Classification. Conversely, each Party shall provide that goods or services may not be considered as being dissimilar from each other on the ground that, in any registration or publication, they are classified in different classes of the Nice Classification.</p>

<h4>Article 18.26: Term of Protection for Trademarks</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide that initial registration and each renewal of registration of a trademark is for a term of no less than 10 years.</p>

<h4>Article 18.27: Non-Recordal of a Licence</h4>

<p>No Party shall require recordal of trademark licences:</p>

<p>(a) to establish the validity of the licence; or</p>

<p>(b) as a condition for use of a trademark by a licensee to be deemed to constitute use by the holder in a proceeding that relates to the acquisition, maintenance or enforcement of trademarks.</p>

<h4>Article 18.28: Domain Names</h4>

<p>1. In connection with each Party’s system for the management of its country-code top-level domain (ccTLD) domain names, the following shall be available:</p>

<p>(a) an appropriate procedure for the settlement of disputes, based on, or modelled along the same lines as, the principles established in the <em>Uniform Domain-Name Dispute-Resolution Policy</em>, as approved by the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) or that:</p>

<p>(i) is designed to resolve disputes expeditiously and at low cost;</p>

<p>(ii) is fair and equitable;</p>

<p>(iii) is not overly burdensome; and</p>

<p>(iv) does not preclude resort to judicial proceedings; and</p>

<p>(b) online public access to a reliable and accurate database of contact information concerning domain-name registrants,</p>

<p>in accordance with each Party’s law and, if applicable, relevant administrator policies regarding protection of privacy and personal data.</p>

<p>2. In connection with each Party’s system for the management of ccTLD domain names, appropriate remedies<a href="#903c">[17]</a> shall be available at least in cases in which a person registers or holds, with a bad faith intent to profit, a domain name that is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark.</p>

<h2>Section D: Country Names</h2>

<h4>Article 18.29: Country Names</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide the legal means for interested persons to prevent commercial use of the country name of a Party in relation to a good in a manner that misleads consumers as to the origin of that good.</p>

<p>The Parties recognise that geographical indications may be protected through a trademark or <em>sui generis</em> system or other legal means.</p>

<h4>Article 18.31: Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications</h4>

<p>If a Party provides administrative procedures for the protection or recognition of geographical indications, whether through a trademark or a <em>sui generis</em> system, that Party shall with respect to applications for that protection or petitions for that recognition:</p>

<p>(a) accept those applications or petitions without requiring intercession by a Party on behalf of its nationals;<a href="#fc0c">[18]</a></p>

<p>(b) process those applications or petitions without imposition of overly burdensome formalities;</p>

<p>(c) ensure that its laws and regulations governing the filing of those applications or petitions are readily available to the public and clearly set out the procedures for these actions;</p>

<p>(d) make available information sufficient to allow the general public to obtain guidance concerning the procedures for filing applications or petitions and the processing of those applications or petitions in general; and allow an applicant, a petitioner, or their representative to ascertain the status of specific applications and petitions;</p>

<p>(e) ensure that those applications or petitions are published for opposition and provide procedures for opposing geographical indications that are the subject of applications or petitions; and</p>

<p>(f) provide for cancellation<a href="#653e">[19]</a> of the protection or recognition afforded to a geographical indication.</p>

<h4>Article 18.32: Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation[20]</h4>

<p>1. If a Party protects or recognises a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide procedures that allow interested persons to object to the protection or recognition of a geographical indication and that allow for any such protection or recognition to be refused or otherwise not afforded, at least, on the following grounds:</p>

<p>(a) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a trademark that is the subject of a pre-existing good faith pending application or registration in the territory of the Party;</p>

<p>(b) the geographical indication is likely to cause confusion with a pre-existing trademark, the rights to which have been acquired in accordance with the Party’s law; and</p>

<p>(c) the geographical indication is a term customary in common language as the common name<a href="#a3a3">[21]</a> for the relevant good in the territory of the Party.</p>

<p>2. If a Party has protected or recognised a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that Party shall provide procedures that allow for interested persons to seek the cancellation of a geographical indication, and that allow for the protection or recognition to be cancelled, at least, on the grounds listed in paragraph 1. A Party may provide that the grounds listed in paragraph 1 shall apply as of the time of filing the request for protection or recognition of a geographical indication in the territory of the Party.<a href="#be80">[22]</a></p>

<p>3. No Party shall preclude the possibility that the protection or recognition of a geographical indication may be cancelled, or otherwise cease, on the basis that the protected or recognised term has ceased meeting the conditions upon which the protection or recognition was originally granted in that Party.</p>

<p>4. If a Party has in place a <em>sui generis</em> system for protecting unregistered geographical indications by means of judicial procedures, that Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to deny the protection or recognition of a geographical indication if any of the circumstances identified in paragraph 1 has been established.<a href="#5aa0">[23]</a> That Party shall also provide a process that allows interested persons to commence a proceeding on the grounds identified in paragraph 1.</p>

<p>5. If a Party provides protection or recognition of a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) to the translation or transliteration of that geographical indication, that Party shall make available procedures that are equivalent to, and grounds that are the same as, those referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 with respect to that translation or transliteration.</p>

<h4>Article 18.33: Guidelines for Determining Whether a Term is the Term Customary in the Common Language</h4>

<p>With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), in determining whether a term is the term customary in common language as the common name for the relevant good in the territory of a Party, that Party’s authorities shall have the authority to take into account how consumers understand the term in the territory of that Party. Factors relevant to such consumer understanding may include:</p>

<p>(a) whether the term is used to refer to the type of good in question, as indicated by competent sources such as dictionaries, newspapers and relevant websites; and</p>

<p>(b) how the good referenced by the term is marketed and used in trade in the territory of that Party.<a href="#7e8a">[24]</a></p>

<p>With respect to the procedures in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), an individual component of a multi-component term that is protected as a geographical indication in the territory of a Party shall not be protected in that Party if that individual component is a term customary in the common language as the common name for the associated good.</p>

<h4>Article 18.35: Date of Protection of a Geographical Indication</h4>

<p>If a Party grants protection or recognition to a geographical indication through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications), that protection or recognition shall commence no earlier than the filing date<a href="#262e">[25]</a> in the Party or the registration date in the Party, as applicable.</p>

<h4>Article 18.36: International Agreements</h4>

<p>1. If a Party protects or recognises a geographical indication pursuant to an international agreement, as of the applicable date under paragraph 6, involving a Party or a non-Party and that geographical indication is not protected through the procedures referred to in Article 18.31 (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications)<a href="#0014">[26]</a> or Article 18.32.4 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), that Party shall apply at least procedures and grounds that are equivalent to those in Article 18.31(e) (Administrative Procedures for the Protection or Recognition of Geographical Indications) and Article 18.32.1 (Grounds of Opposition and Cancellation), as well as:</p>

<p>(a) make available information sufficient to allow the general public to obtain guidance concerning the procedures for protecting or recognising the geographical indication and allow interested persons to ascertain the status of requests for protection or recognition;</p>

<p>(b) make available to the public, on the Internet, details regarding the terms that the Party is considering protecting or recognising through an international agreement involving a Party or a non-party, including specifying whether the protection or recognition is being considered for any translations or transliterations of those terms, and with respect to multi-component terms, specifying the components, if any, for which protection or recognition is being considered, or the components that are disclaimed;</p>

<p>(c) in respect of opposition procedures, provide a reasonable period of time for interested persons to oppose the protection or recognition of the terms referred to in subparagraph (b). That period shall provide a meaningful opportunity for interested persons to participate in an opposition process; and</p>

<p>(d) inform the other Parties of the opportunity to oppose, no later than the commencement of the opposition period.</p>

<p>2. In respect of international agreements covered by paragraph 6 that permit the protection or recognition of a new geographical indication, a Party shall:<a href="#f0d2">[27]</a>,<a href="#fcb3">[28]</a></p>

<p>(a) apply paragraph 1(b);</p>

<p>(b) provide an opportunity for interested persons to comment regarding the protection or recognition of the new geographical indication for a reasonable period of time before such a term is protected or recognised; and</p>

<p>5. Protection or recognition provided pursuant to paragraph 1 shall commence no earlier than the date on which the agreement enters into force or, if that Party grants that protection or recognition on a date after the entry into force of the agreement, on that later date.</p>

<p>6. No Party shall be required to apply this Article to geographical indications that have been specifically identified in, and that are protected or recognised pursuant to, an international agreement involving a Party or a non-Party, provided that the agreement:</p>

<p>(a) was concluded, or agreed in principle,<a href="#d87c">[29]</a> prior to the date of conclusion, or agreement in principle, of this Agreement;</p>

<p>(b) was ratified by a Party prior to the date of ratification of this Agreement by that Party; or</p>

<h4>Article 18.37: Patentable Subject Matter</h4>

<p>1. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4, each Party shall make patents available for any invention, whether a product or process, in all fields of technology, provided that the invention is new, involves an inventive step and is capable of industrial application.<a href="#2b79">[30]</a></p>

<p>2. Subject to paragraphs 3 and 4 and consistent with paragraph 1, each Party confirms that patents are available for inventions claimed as at least one of the following: new uses of a known product, new methods of using a known product, or new processes of using a known product. A Party may limit those new processes to those that do not claim the use of the product as such.</p>

<p>3. A Party may exclude from patentability inventions, the prevention within their territory of the commercial exploitation of which is necessary to protect <em>ordre public</em> or morality, including to protect human, animal or plant life or health or to avoid serious prejudice to nature or the environment, provided that such exclusion is not made merely because the exploitation is prohibited by its law. A Party may also exclude from patentability:</p>

<p>(a) diagnostic, therapeutic and surgical methods for the treatment of humans or animals;</p>

<p>(b) animals other than microorganisms, and essentially biological processes for the production of plants or animals, other than non-biological and microbiological processes.</p>

<h4>Article 18.39: Patent Revocation</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that a patent may be cancelled, revoked or nullified only on grounds that would have justified a refusal to grant the patent. A Party may also provide that fraud, misrepresentation or inequitable conduct may be the basis for cancelling, revoking or nullifying a patent or holding a patent unenforceable.</p>

<p>2. Notwithstanding paragraph 1, a Party may provide that a patent may be revoked, provided it is done in a manner consistent with Article 5A of the Paris Convention and the TRIPS Agreement.</p>

<h4>Article 18.40: Exceptions</h4>

<p>A Party may provide limited exceptions to the exclusive rights conferred by a patent, provided that such exceptions do not unreasonably conflict with a normal exploitation of the patent and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the patent owner, taking account of the legitimate interests of third parties.</p>

<h4>Article 18.41: Other Use Without Authorisation of the Right Holder</h4>

<p>The Parties understand that nothing in this Chapter limits a Party’s rights and obligations under Article 31 of the TRIPS Agreement, any waiver or any amendment to that Article that the Parties accept.</p>

<h4>Article 18.42: Patent Filing</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide that if an invention is made independently by more than one inventor, and separate applications claiming that invention are filed with, or for, the relevant authority of the Party, that Party shall grant the patent on the application that is patentable and that has the earliest filing date or, if applicable, priority date,<a href="#e722">[33]</a> unless that application has, prior to publication,<a href="#90b1">[34]</a> been withdrawn, abandoned or refused.</p>

<p>(i) that information; or</p>

<p>(ii) the marketing approval granted to the person that submitted such information,</p>

<p>for at least five years<a href="#e691">[53]</a> from the date of marketing approval of the new pharmaceutical product in the territory of the Party.</p>

<p>(b) If a Party permits, as a condition of granting marketing approval for a new pharmaceutical product, the submission of evidence of prior marketing approval of the product in another territory, that Party shall not permit third persons, without the consent of a person that previously submitted such information concerning the safety and efficacy of the product, to market a same or a similar product based on evidence relating to prior marketing approval in the other territory for at least five years from the date of marketing approval of the new pharmaceutical product in the territory of that Party.<a href="#f0ec">[54]</a></p>

<p>2. Each Party shall:<a href="#2e0c">[55]</a></p>

<p>(a) apply paragraph 1, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, for a period of at least three years with respect to new clinical information submitted as required in support of a marketing approval of a previously approved pharmaceutical product covering a new indication, new formulation or new method of administration; or, alternatively,</p>

<p>(b) apply paragraph 1, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, for a period of at least five years to new pharmaceutical products that contain a chemical entity that has not been previously approved in that Party.<a href="#e422">[56]</a></p>

<p>(ii) failing such authorised publication within 25 years from the creation of the work, performance or phonogram, not less than 70 years from the end of the calendar year of the creation of the work, performance or phonogram.<a href="#1f9b">[76]</a></p>

<h4>Article 18.64: Application of Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement</h4>

<p>Each Party shall apply Article 18 of the Berne Convention and Article 14.6 of the TRIPS Agreement, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>, to works, performances and phonograms, and the rights in and protections afforded to that subject matter as required by this Section.</p>

<h4>Article 18.65: Limitations and Exceptions</h4>

<p>1. With respect to this Section, each Party shall confine limitations or exceptions to exclusive rights to certain special cases that do not conflict with a normal exploitation of the work, performance, or phonogram, and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the right holder.</p>

<p>2. This Article does not reduce or extend the scope of applicability of the limitations and exceptions permitted by the TRIPS Agreement, the Berne Convention, the WCT or the WPPT.</p>

<h4>Article 18.66: Balance in Copyright and Related Rights Systems</h4>

<p>Each Party shall endeavour to achieve an appropriate balance in its copyright and related rights system, among other things by means of limitations or exceptions that are consistent with Article 18.65 (Limitations and Exceptions), including those for the digital environment, giving due consideration to legitimate purposes such as, but not limited to: criticism; comment; news reporting; teaching, scholarship, research, and other similar purposes; and facilitating access to published works for persons who are blind, visually impaired or otherwise print disabled.<a href="#4932">[77]</a>,<a href="#a16a">[78]</a></p>

<h4>Article 18.67: Contractual Transfers</h4>

<p>Each Party shall provide that for copyright and related rights, any person acquiring or holding any economic right<a href="#8030">[79]</a> in a work, performance or phonogram:</p>

<p>(a) may freely and separately transfer that right by contract; and</p>

<p>(b) by virtue of contract, including contracts of employment underlying the creation of works, performances or phonograms, shall be able to exercise that right in that person’s own name and enjoy fully the benefits derived from that right.<a href="#0dd2">[80]</a></p>

<h4>Article 18.68: Technological Protection Measures (TPMs)[81]</h4>

<p>1. In order to provide adequate legal protection and effective legal remedies against the circumvention of effective technological measures that authors, performers, and producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights and that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, performances, and phonograms, each Party shall provide that any person that:</p>

<p>(a) knowingly, or having reasonable grounds to know,<a href="#f391">[82]</a> circumvents without authority any effective technological measure that controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram;<a href="#68c7">[83]</a> or</p>

<p>(b) manufactures, imports, distributes,<a href="#b6a2">[84]</a> offers for sale or rental to the public, or otherwise provides devices, products, or components, or offers to the public or provides services, that:</p>

<p>(i) are promoted, advertised, or otherwise marketed by that person<a href="#3e18">[85]</a> for the purpose of circumventing any effective technological measure;</p>

<p>(ii) have only a limited commercially significant purpose or use other than to circumvent any effective technological measure;<a href="#a75e">[86]</a> or</p>

<p>(iii) are primarily designed, produced, or performed for the purpose of circumventing any effective technological measure,</p>

<p>is liable and subject to the remedies provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies).</p>

<p>A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties do not apply to a non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution, or public non-commercial broadcasting entity. A Party may also provide that the remedies provided for in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies) do not apply to any of the same entities provided that the above activities are carried out in good faith without knowledge that the conduct is prohibited.</p>

<p>2. In implementing paragraph 1, no Party shall be obligated to require that the design of, or the design and selection of parts and components for, a consumer electronics, telecommunications, or computing product provide for a response to any particular technological measure, provided that the product does not otherwise violate a measure implementing paragraph 1.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide that a violation of a measure implementing this Article is independent of any infringement that might occur under the Party’s law on copyright and related rights.<a href="#3ec2">[90]</a></p>

<p>4. With regard to measures implementing paragraph 1:</p>

<p>(a) a Party may provide certain limitations and exceptions to the measures implementing paragraph 1(a) or paragraph 1(b) in order to enable non-infringing uses if there is an actual or likely adverse impact of those measures on those non-infringing uses, as determined through a legislative, regulatory, or administrative process in accordance with the Party’s law, giving due consideration to evidence when presented in that process, including with respect to whether appropriate and effective measures have been taken by rights holders to enable the beneficiaries to enjoy the limitations and exceptions to copyright and related rights under that Party’s law;<a href="#6220">[91]</a></p>

<p>(b) any limitations or exceptions to a measure that implements paragraph 1(b) shall be permitted only to enable the legitimate use of a limitation or exception permissible under this Article by its intended beneficiaries<a href="#c699">[92]</a> and does not authorise the making available of devices, products, components, or services beyond those intended beneficiaries;<a href="#1ca2">[93]</a> and</p>

<p>(c) a Party shall not, by providing limitations and exceptions under paragraph 4(a) and paragraph 4(b), undermine the adequacy of that Party’s legal system for the protection of effective technological measures, or the effectiveness of legal remedies against the circumvention of such measures, that authors, performers, or producers of phonograms use in connection with the exercise of their rights, or that restrict unauthorised acts in respect of their works, performances or phonograms, as provided for in this Chapter.</p>

<p>5. <strong>effective technological measure</strong> means any effective<a href="#1c0d">[94]</a> technology, device, or component that, in the normal course of its operation, controls access to a protected work, performance, or phonogram, or protects copyright or related rights related to a work, performance or phonogram.</p>

<h4>Article 18.69: Rights Management Information (RMI) [95]</h4>

<p>1. In order to provide adequate and effective legal remedies to protect RMI:</p>

<p>(a) each Party shall provide that any person that, without authority, and knowing, or having reasonable grounds to know, that it would induce, enable, facilitate or conceal an infringement of the copyright or related right of authors, performers or producers of phonograms:</p>

<p>(i) knowingly<a href="#95e5">[96]</a> removes or alters any RMI;</p>

<p>(ii) knowingly distributes or imports for distribution RMI knowing that the RMI has been altered without authority;<a href="#a84e">[97]</a> or</p>

<p>(iii) knowingly distributes, imports for distribution, broadcasts, communicates or makes available to the public copies of works, performances or phonograms, knowing that RMI has been removed or altered without authority,</p>

<p>is liable and subject to the remedies set out in Article 18.74(Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies).</p>

<p>Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied if any person is found to have engaged wilfully and for purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain in any of the activities described in subparagraph (a).</p>

<p>A Party may provide that the criminal procedures and penalties referred to in paragraph 1(b) do not apply to a non-profit library, museum, archive, educational institution or public non-commercial broadcasting entity.<a href="#650b">[98]</a></p>

<p>2. For greater certainty, nothing prevents a Party from excluding from a measure that implements paragraph 1 a lawfully authorised activity that is carried out for the purpose of law enforcement, essential security interests or other related governmental purposes, such as the performance of a statutory function.</p>

<p>3. For greater certainty, nothing in this Article shall obligate a Party to require a right holder in a work, performance or phonogram to attach RMI to copies of the work, performance or phonogram, or to cause RMI to appear in connection with a communication of the work, performance or phonogram to the public.</p>

<p>4. <strong>RMI</strong> means:</p>

<p>(a) information that identifies a work, performance or phonogram, the author of the work, the performer of the performance or the producer of the phonogram; or the owner of any right in the work, performance or phonogram;</p>

<p>(b) information about the terms and conditions of the use of the work, performance or phonogram; or</p>

<p>(c) any numbers or codes that represent the information referred to in subparagraphs (a) and (b),</p>

<p>if any of these items is attached to a copy of the work, performance or phonogram or appears in connection with the communication or making available of a work, performance or phonogram to the public.</p>

<h4>Article 18.70: Collective Management</h4>

<p>The Parties recognise the important role of collective management societies for copyright and related rights in collecting and distributing royalties<a href="#b097">[99]</a> based on practices that are fair, efficient, transparent and accountable, which may include appropriate record keeping and reporting mechanisms.</p>

<h2>Section I: Enforcement</h2>

<h4>Article 18.71: General Obligations</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall ensure that enforcement procedures as specified in this Section are available under its law<a href="#7c6b">[100]</a> so as to permit effective action against any act of infringement of intellectual property rights covered by this Chapter, including expeditious remedies to prevent infringements and remedies that constitute a deterrent to future infringements.<a href="#d8bc">[101]</a> These procedures shall be applied in such a manner as to avoid the creation of barriers to legitimate trade and to provide for safeguards against their abuse.</p>

<p>2. Each Party confirms that the enforcement procedures set forth in Article 18.74 (Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies), Article 18.75 (Provisional Measures) and Article 18.77 (Criminal Procedures and Penalties) shall be available to the same extent with respect to acts of trademark infringement, as well as copyright or related rights infringement, in the digital environment.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall ensure that its procedures concerning the enforcement of intellectual property rights are fair and equitable. These procedures shall not be unnecessarily complicated or costly, or entail unreasonable time-limits or unwarranted delays.</p>

<p>4. This Section does not create any obligation:</p>

<p>(a) to put in place a judicial system for the enforcement of intellectual property rights distinct from that for the enforcement of law in general, nor does it affect the capacity of each Party to enforce its law in general; or</p>

<p>(b) with respect to the distribution of resources as between the enforcement of intellectual property rights and the enforcement of law in general.</p>

<p>5. In implementing the provisions of this Section in its intellectual property system, each Party shall take into account the need for proportionality between the seriousness of the infringement of the intellectual property right and the applicable remedies and penalties, as well as the interests of third parties.</p>

<h4>Article 18.72: Presumptions</h4>

<p>1. In civil, criminal and, if applicable, administrative proceedings involving copyright or related rights, each Party shall provide for a presumption<a href="#0705">[102]</a> that, in the absence of proof to the contrary:</p>

<p>(a) the person whose name is indicated in the usual manner<a href="#85fe">[103]</a> as the author, performer or producer of the work, performance or phonogram, or if applicable the publisher, is the designated right holder in that work, performance or phonogram; and</p>

<p>(b) the copyright or related right subsists in such subject matter.</p>

<p>2. In connection with the commencement of a civil, administrative or criminal enforcement proceeding involving a registered trademark that has been substantively examined by its competent authority, each Party shall provide that the trademark be considered <em>prima facie</em> valid.</p>

<p>3. In connection with the commencement of a civil or administrative enforcement proceeding involving a patent that has been substantively examined and granted<a href="#4686">[104]</a> by the competent authority of a Party, that Party shall provide that each claim in the patent be considered <em>prima facie</em> to satisfy the applicable criteria of patentability in the territory of the Party.<a href="#0c38">[105]</a>,<a href="#eb23">[106]</a></p>

<h4>Article 18.73: Enforcement Practices with Respect to Intellectual Property Rights</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide that final judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application pertaining to the enforcement of intellectual property rights:</p>

<p>(a) preferably are in writing and state any relevant findings of fact and the reasoning or the legal basis on which the decisions and rulings are based; and</p>

<p>(b) are published<a href="#0301">[107]</a> or, if publication is not practicable, otherwise made available to the public in a national language in such a manner as to enable interested persons and Parties to become acquainted with them.</p>

<p>2. Each Party recognises the importance of collecting and analysing statistical data and other relevant information concerning infringements of intellectual property rights as well as collecting information on best practices to prevent and combat infringements.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall publish or otherwise make available to the public information on its efforts to provide effective enforcement of intellectual property rights in its civil, administrative and criminal systems, such as statistical information that the Party may collect for such purposes.</p>

<h4>Article 18.74: Civil and Administrative Procedures and Remedies</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall make available to right holders civil judicial procedures concerning the enforcement of any intellectual property right covered in this Chapter.<a href="#e412">[108]</a></p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order injunctive relief that conforms to Article 44 of the TRIPS Agreement, including to prevent goods that involve the infringement of an intellectual property right under the law of the Party providing that relief from entering into the channels of commerce.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide<a href="#9124">[109]</a> that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority at least to order the infringer to pay the right holder damages adequate to compensate for the injury the right holder has suffered because of an infringement of that person’s intellectual property right by an infringer who knowingly, or with reasonable grounds to know, engaged in infringing activity.</p>

<p>4. In determining the amount of damages under paragraph 3, each Party’s judicial authorities shall have the authority to consider, among other things, any legitimate measure of value the right holder submits, which may include lost profits, the value of the infringed goods or services measured by the market price, or the suggested retail price.</p>

<p>5.At least in cases of copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings, its judicial authorities have the authority to order the infringer, at least in cases described in paragraph 3, to pay the right holder the infringer’s profits that are attributable to the infringement.<a href="#0740">[110]</a></p>

<p>6. In civil judicial proceedings with respect to the infringement of copyright or related rights protecting works, phonograms or performances, each Party shall establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following:</p>

<p>(a) pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder; or</p>

<p>(b) additional damages.<a href="#0fd7">[111]</a></p>

<p>7. In civil judicial proceedings with respect to trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall also establish or maintain a system that provides for one or more of the following:</p>

<p>(a) pre-established damages, which shall be available on the election of the right holder; or</p>

<p>(b) additional damages.<a href="#c348">[112]</a></p>

<p>8. Pre-established damages under paragraphs 6 and 7 shall be set out in an amount that would be sufficient to compensate the right holder for the harm caused by the infringement, and with a view to deterring future infringements.</p>

<p>9. In awarding additional damages under paragraphs 6 and 7, judicial authorities shall have the authority to award such additional damages as they consider appropriate, having regard to all relevant matters, including the nature of the infringing conduct and the need to deter similar infringements in the future.</p>

<p>10. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities, if appropriate, have the authority to order, at the conclusion of civil judicial proceedings concerning infringement of at least copyright or related rights, patents and trademarks, that the prevailing party be awarded payment by the losing party of court costs or fees and appropriate attorney’s fees, or any other expenses as provided for under the Party’s law.</p>

<p>11. If a Party’s judicial or other authorities appoint a technical or other expert in a civil proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right and require that the parties to the proceeding pay the costs of that expert, that Party should seek to ensure that those costs are reasonable and related appropriately, among other things, to the quantity and nature of work to be performed and do not unreasonably deter recourse to such proceedings.</p>

<p>12. Each Party shall provide that in civil judicial proceedings:</p>

<p>(a) at least with respect to pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods, its judicial authorities have the authority, at the right holder’s request, to order that the infringing goods be destroyed, except in exceptional circumstances, without compensation of any sort;</p>

<p>(b) its judicial authorities have the authority to order that materials and implements that have been used in the manufacture or creation of the infringing goods be, without undue delay and without compensation of any sort, destroyed or disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to minimise the risk of further infringement; and</p>

<p>(c) in regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed is not sufficient, other than in exceptional circumstances, to permit the release of goods into the channels of commerce.</p>

<p>13. Without prejudice to its law governing privilege, the protection of confidentiality of information sources or the processing of personal data, each Party shall provide that, in civil judicial proceedings concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right, its judicial authorities have the authority, on a justified request of the right holder, to order the infringer or, in the alternative, the alleged infringer to provide to the right holder or to the judicial authorities, at least for the purpose of collecting evidence, relevant information as provided for in its applicable laws and regulations that the infringer or alleged infringer possesses or controls. The information may include information regarding any person involved in any aspect of the infringement or alleged infringement and the means of production or the channels of distribution of the infringing or allegedly infringing goods or services, including the identification of third persons alleged to be involved in the production and distribution of the goods or services and of their channels of distribution.</p>

<p>14. Each Party shall provide that in relation to a civil judicial proceeding concerning the enforcement of an intellectual property right, its judicial or other authorities have the authority to impose sanctions on a party, counsel, experts or other persons subject to the court’s jurisdiction for violation of judicial orders concerning the protection of confidential information produced or exchanged in that proceeding.</p>

<p>15. Each Party shall ensure that its judicial authorities have the authority to order a party at whose request measures were taken and that has abused enforcement procedures with regard to intellectual property rights, including trademarks, geographical indications, patents, copyright and related rights and industrial designs, to provide to a party wrongfully enjoined or restrained adequate compensation for the injury suffered because of that abuse. The judicial authorities shall also have the authority to order the applicant to pay the defendant expenses, which may include appropriate attorney’s fees.</p>

<p>16. To the extent that any civil remedy can be ordered as a result of administrative procedures on the merits of a case, each Party shall provide that those procedures conform to principles equivalent in substance to those set out in this Article.</p>

<p>17. In civil judicial proceedings concerning the acts described in Article 18.68 (TPMs) and Article 18.69 (RMI):</p>

<p>(a) each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority at least to:<a href="#422c">[113]</a></p>

<p>(i) impose provisional measures, including seizure or other taking into custody of devices and products suspected of being involved in the prohibited activity;</p>

<p>(ii) order the type of damages available for copyright infringement, as provided under its law in accordance with this Article;<a href="#9681">[114]</a></p>

<p>(iii) order court costs, fees or expenses as provided for under paragraph 10; and</p>

<p>(iv) order the destruction of devices and products found to be involved in the prohibited activity; and</p>

<p>(b) a Party may provide that damages shall not be available against a non-profit library, archive, educational institution, museum or public non-commercial broadcasting entity, if it sustains the burden of proving that it was not aware or had no reason to believe that its acts constituted a prohibited activity.</p>

<h4>Article 18.75: Provisional Measures</h4>

<p>1. Each Party’s authorities shall act on a request for relief in respect of an intellectual property right <em>inaudita altera parte</em> expeditiously in accordance with that Party’s judicial rules.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to require the applicant for a provisional measure in respect of an intellectual property right to provide any reasonably available evidence in order to satisfy the judicial authority, with a sufficient degree of certainty, that the applicant’s right is being infringed or that the infringement is imminent, and to order the applicant to provide security or equivalent assurance set at a level sufficient to protect the defendant and to prevent abuse. Such security or equivalent assurance shall not unreasonably deter recourse to those procedures.</p>

<p>3. In civil judicial proceedings concerning copyright or related rights infringement and trademark counterfeiting, each Party shall provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or other taking into custody of suspected infringing goods, materials and implements relevant to the infringement, and, at least for trademark counterfeiting, documentary evidence relevant to the infringement.</p>

<h4>Article 18.76: Special Requirements related to Border Measures</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide for applications to suspend the release of, or to detain, any suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods that are imported into the territory of the Party.<a href="#d9f5">[115]</a></p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide that any right holder initiating procedures for its competent authorities<a href="#8078">[116]</a> to suspend release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods into free circulation is required to provide adequate evidence to satisfy the competent authorities that, under the law of the Party providing the procedures, there is <em>prima facie</em> an infringement of the right holder’s intellectual property right and to supply sufficient information that may reasonably be expected to be within the right holder’s knowledge to make the suspect goods reasonably recognisable by its competent authorities. The requirement to provide that information shall not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to require a right holder initiating procedures to suspend the release of suspected counterfeit or confusingly similar trademark or pirated copyright goods, to provide a reasonable security or equivalent assurance sufficient to protect the defendant and the competent authorities and to prevent abuse. Each Party shall provide that such security or equivalent assurance does not unreasonably deter recourse to these procedures. A Party may provide that the security may be in the form of a bond conditioned to hold the defendant harmless from any loss or damage resulting from any suspension of the release of goods in the event the competent authorities determine that the article is not an infringing good.</p>

<p>4. Without prejudice to a Party’s law pertaining to privacy or the confidentiality of information:</p>

<p>(a) if a Party’s competent authorities have detained or suspended the release of goods that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark or pirated copyright goods, that Party may provide that its competent authorities have the authority to inform the right holder without undue delay of the names and addresses of the consignor, exporter, consignee or importer; a description of the goods; the quantity of the goods; and, if known, the country of origin of the goods;<a href="#f383">[117]</a> or</p>

<p>(b) if a Party does not provide its competent authority with the authority referred to in subparagraph (a) when suspect goods are detained or suspended from release, it shall provide, at least in cases of imported goods, its competent authorities with the authority to provide the information specified in subparagraph (a) to the right holder normally within 30 working days of the seizure or determination that the goods are counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods.</p>

<p>5. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities may initiate border measures <em>ex officio</em><a href="#e624">[118]</a> with respect to goods under customs control<a href="#b8a9">[119]</a> that are:</p>

<p>(a) imported;</p>

<p>(b) destined for export;<a href="#e71d">[120]</a> or</p>

<p>(c) in transit,<a href="#70d3">[121]</a>,<a href="#0e5b">[122]</a></p>

<p>and that are suspected of being counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods.</p>

<p>6. Each Party shall adopt or maintain a procedure by which its competent authorities may determine within a reasonable period of time after the initiation of the procedures described in paragraph 1, paragraph 5(a), paragraph 5(b) and, if applicable, paragraph 5(c), whether the suspect goods infringe an intellectual property right.<a href="#a3e0">[123]</a> If a Party provides administrative procedures for the determination of an infringement, it may also provide its authorities with the authority to impose administrative penalties or sanctions, which may include fines or the seizure of the infringing goods following a determination that the goods are infringing.</p>

<p>7. Each Party shall provide that its competent authorities have the authority to order the destruction of goods following a determination that the goods are infringing. In cases in which the goods are not destroyed, each Party shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, the goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid any harm to the right holder. In regard to counterfeit trademark goods, the simple removal of the trademark unlawfully affixed shall not be sufficient, other than in exceptional cases, to permit the release of the goods into the channels of commerce.</p>

<p>8. If a Party establishes or assesses, in connection with the procedures described in this Article, an application fee, storage fee or destruction fee, that fee shall not be set at an amount that unreasonably deters recourse to these procedures.</p>

<p>9. This Article also shall apply to goods of a commercial nature sent in small consignments. A Party may exclude from the application of this Article small quantities of goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal luggage.<a href="#831f">[124]</a></p>

<h4>Article 18.77: Criminal Procedures and Penalties</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied at least in cases of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale. In respect of wilful copyright or related rights piracy, “on a commercial scale” includes at least:</p>

<p>(a) acts carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain; and</p>

<p>(b) significant acts, not carried out for commercial advantage or financial gain, that have a substantial prejudicial impact on the interests of the copyright or related rights holder in relation to the marketplace.<a href="#7bb6">[125]</a>,<a href="#7162">[126]</a></p>

<p>2. Each Party shall treat wilful importation or exportation of counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods on a commercial scale as unlawful activities subject to criminal penalties.<a href="#e769">[127]</a></p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide for criminal procedures and penalties to be applied in cases of wilful importation<a href="#a675">[128]</a> and domestic use, in the course of trade and on a commercial scale, of a label or packaging:<a href="#140e">[129]</a></p>

<p>(a) to which a trademark has been applied without authorisation that is identical to, or cannot be distinguished from, a trademark registered in its territory; and</p>

<p>(b) that is intended to be used in the course of trade on goods or in relation to services that are identical to goods or services for which that trademark is registered.</p>

<p>4. Recognising the need to address the unauthorised copying<a href="#8728">[130]</a> of a cinematographic work from a performance in a movie theatre that causes significant harm to a right holder in the market for that work, and recognising the need to deter such harm, each Party shall adopt or maintain measures, which shall at a minimum include, but need not be limited to, appropriate criminal procedures and penalties.</p>

<p>5. With respect to the offences for which this Article requires a Party to provide for criminal procedures and penalties, each Party shall ensure that criminal liability for aiding and abetting is available under its law.</p>

<p>6. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, each Party shall provide the following:</p>

<p>(a) Penalties that include sentences of imprisonment as well as monetary fines sufficiently high to provide a deterrent to future acts of infringement, consistent with the level of penalties applied for crimes of a corresponding gravity.<a href="#c36d">[131]</a></p>

<p>(b) Its judicial authorities have the authority, in determining penalties, to account for the seriousness of the circumstances, which may include circumstances that involve threats to, or effects on, health or safety.<a href="#780b">[132]</a></p>

<p>(c) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to order the seizure of suspected counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods, any related materials and implements used in the commission of the alleged offence, documentary evidence relevant to the alleged offence and assets derived from, or obtained through the alleged infringing activity. If a Party requires identification of items subject to seizure as a prerequisite for issuing a judicial order referred to in this subparagraph, that Party shall not require the items to be described in greater detail than necessary to identify them for the purpose of seizure.</p>

<p><a href="https://medium.com/p/3479efdc7adf/edit">(d) Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture, at least for serious offences, of any assets derived from or obtained through the infringing activity.</a></p>

<p>(e) Its judicial authorities have the authority to order the forfeiture or destruction of:</p>

<p>(i) all counterfeit trademark goods or pirated copyright goods;</p>

<p>(ii) <a href="https://medium.com/p/3479efdc7adf/edit">materials and implements</a> that have been predominantly used in the creation of pirated copyright goods or counterfeit trademark goods; and</p>

<p>(iii) any other labels or packaging to which a counterfeit trademark has been applied and that have been used in the commission of the offence.</p>

<p>In cases in which counterfeit trademark goods and pirated copyright goods are not destroyed, the judicial or other competent authorities shall ensure that, except in exceptional circumstances, those goods are disposed of outside the channels of commerce in such a manner as to avoid causing any harm to the right holder. Each Party shall further provide that forfeiture or destruction under this subparagraph and subparagraph (c) shall occur without compensation of any kind to the defendant.</p>

<p>(f) Its judicial or other competent authorities have the authority to release or, in the alternative, provide access to, goods, material, implements, and other evidence held by the relevant authority to a right holder for civil<a href="#6324">[133]</a> infringement proceedings.</p>

<p>(g) Its competent authorities may act upon their own initiative to initiate legal action without the need for a formal complaint by a third person or right holder.<a href="#1698">[134]</a></p>

<p>7. With respect to the offences described in paragraphs 1 through 5, a Party may provide that its judicial authorities have the authority to order the seizure or forfeiture of assets, or alternatively, a fine, the value of which corresponds to the assets derived from, or obtained directly or indirectly through, the infringing activity.</p>

<h4>Article 18.78: Trade Secrets[135]</h4>

<p>1. In the course of ensuring effective protection against unfair competition as provided in Article 10_bis_ of the Paris Convention, each Party shall ensure that persons have the legal means to prevent trade secrets lawfully in their control from being disclosed to, acquired by, or used by others (including state-owned enterprises) without their consent in a manner contrary to honest commercial practices.<a href="#0ffb">[136]</a> As used in this Chapter, trade secrets encompass, at a minimum, undisclosed information as provided for in Article 39.2 of the TRIPS Agreement.</p>

<p>(a) the unauthorised and wilful access to a trade secret held in a computer system;</p>

<p>(b) the unauthorised and wilful misappropriation<a href="#ecd9">[137]</a> of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system; or</p>

<p>(c) the fraudulent disclosure, or alternatively, the unauthorised and wilful disclosure, of a trade secret, including by means of a computer system.</p>

<p>3. With respect to the relevant acts referred to in paragraph 2, a Party may, as appropriate, limit the availability of its criminal procedures, or limit the level of penalties available, to one or more of the following cases in which:</p>

<p>(a) the acts are for the purposes of commercial advantage or financial gain;</p>

<p>(b) the acts are related to a product or service in national or international commerce;</p>

<p>(c) the acts are intended to injure the owner of such trade secret;</p>

<p>(d) the acts are directed by or for the benefit of or in association with a foreign economic entity; or</p>

<p>(e) the acts are detrimental to a Party’s economic interests, international relations, or national defence or national security.</p>

<h4>Article 18.79: Protection of Encrypted Program-Carrying Satellite and Cable Signals</h4>

<p>1. Each Party shall make it a criminal offence to:</p>

<p>(a) manufacture, assemble, modify,<a href="#f208">[138]</a> import, export, sell, lease or otherwise distribute a tangible or intangible device or system knowing or having reason to know<a href="#4c79">[139]</a> that the device or system meets at least one of the following conditions:</p>

<p>(i) it is intended to be used to assist;</p>

<p>(ii) it is primarily of assistance; or</p>

<p>(iii) its principal function is solely to assist,</p>

<p>in decoding an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal without the authorisation of the lawful distributor<a href="#8893">[140]</a> of such signal;<a href="#5988">[141]</a> and</p>

<p>(b) with respect to an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal, wilfully:</p>

<p>(i) receive<a href="#2236">[142]</a> such a signal; or</p>

<p>(ii) further distribute<a href="#7dbf">[143]</a> such signal,</p>

<p>knowing that it has been decoded without the authorisation of the lawful distributor of the signal.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall provide for civil remedies for a person that holds an interest in an encrypted program-carrying satellite signal or its content and that is injured by an activity described in paragraph 1.</p>

<p>3. Each Party shall provide for criminal penalties or civil remedies<a href="#e7a9">[144]</a> for wilfully:</p>

<p>(a) manufacturing or distributing equipment knowing that the equipment is intended to be used in the unauthorised reception of any encrypted program-carrying cable signal; and</p>

<h4>Article 18.80: Government Use of Software</h4>

<p>1. Each Party recognises the importance of promoting the adoption of measures to enhance government awareness of respect for intellectual property rights and of the detrimental effects of the infringement of intellectual property rights.</p>

<p>2. Each Party shall adopt or maintain appropriate laws, regulations, policies, orders, government-issued guidelines, or administrative or executive decrees that provide that its central government agencies use only non-infringing computer software protected by copyright and related rights, and, if applicable, only use that computer software in a manner authorised by the relevant licence. These measures shall apply to the acquisition and management of the software for government use.<a href="#e9af">[146]</a></p>

<h2>Section J: Internet Service Providers[147]</h2>

<h4>Article 18.81: Definitions</h4>

<p>For the purposes of this Section:</p>

<p>the term <strong>copyright</strong> includes related rights; and</p>

<p><strong>Internet Service Provider</strong> means:</p>

<p>(a) a provider of online services for the transmission, routing, or providing of connections for digital online communications, between or among points specified by a user, of material of the user’s choosing, undertaking the function in Article 18.82.2(a) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours); or</p>

<p>(b) a provider of online services undertaking the functions in Article 18.82.2(c) or Article 18.82.2(d) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours).</p>

<p>For greater certainty, Internet Service Provider includes a provider of the services listed above that engages in caching carried out through an automated process.</p>

<h4>Article 18.82: Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours[148]</h4>

<p>1. The Parties recognise the importance of facilitating the continued development of legitimate online services operating as intermediaries and, in a manner consistent with Article 41 of the TRIPS Agreement, providing enforcement procedures that permit effective action by right holders against copyright infringement covered under this Chapter that occurs in the online environment. Accordingly, each Party shall ensure that legal remedies are available for right holders to address such copyright infringement and shall establish or maintain appropriate safe harbours in respect of online services that are Internet Service Providers. This framework of legal remedies and safe harbours shall include:</p>

<p>(a) legal incentives<a href="#206f">[149]</a> for Internet Service Providers to cooperate with copyright owners to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials or, in the alternative, to take other action to deter the unauthorised storage and transmission of copyrighted materials; and</p>

<p>(b) limitations in its law that have the effect of precluding monetary relief against Internet Service Providers for copyright infringements that they do not control, initiate or direct, and that take place through systems or networks controlled or operated by them or on their behalf.<a href="#0344">[150]</a></p>

<p>2. The limitations described in paragraph 1(b) shall include limitations in respect of the following functions:</p>

<p>(a) transmitting, routing or providing connections for material without modification of its content<a href="#0b47">[151]</a> or the intermediate and transient storage of that material done automatically in the course of such a technical process;</p>

<p>(b) caching carried out through an automated process;</p>

<p>(c) storage,<a href="#a159">[152]</a> at the direction of a user, of material residing on a system or network controlled or operated by or for the Internet Service Provider;<a href="#1e82">[153]</a> and</p>

<p>(d) referring or linking users to an online location by using information location tools, including hyperlinks and directories.</p>

<p>3. To facilitate effective action to address infringement, each Party shall prescribe in its law conditions for Internet Service Providers to qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b), or, alternatively, shall provide for circumstances under which Internet Service Providers do not qualify for the limitations described in paragraph 1(b):<a href="#fd67">[154]</a>,<a href="#9fca">[155]</a></p>

<p>(a) With respect to the functions referred to in paragraph 2(c) and paragraph 2(d), these conditions shall include a requirement for Internet Service Providers to expeditiously remove or disable access to material residing on their networks or systems upon obtaining actual knowledge of the copyright infringement or becoming aware of facts or circumstances from which the infringement is apparent, such as through receiving a notice<a href="#301d">[156]</a> of alleged infringement from the right holder or a person authorised to act on its behalf,</p>

<p>(b) An Internet Service Provider that removes or disables access to material in good faith under subparagraph (a) shall be exempt from any liability for having done so, provided that it takes reasonable steps in advance or promptly after to notify the person whose material is removed or disabled.<a href="#c88a">[157]</a></p>

<p>4. If a system for counter-notices is provided under a Party’s law, and if material has been removed or access has been disabled in accordance with paragraph 3, that Party shall require that the Internet Service Provider restores the material subject to a counter-notice, unless the person giving the original notice seeks judicial relief within a reasonable period of time.</p>

<p>5. Each Party shall ensure that monetary remedies are available in its legal system against any person that makes a knowing material misrepresentation in a notice or counter-notice that causes injury to any interested party<a href="#0437">[158]</a> as a result of an Internet Service Provider relying on the misrepresentation.</p>

<p>6. Eligibility for the limitations in paragraph 1 shall not be conditioned on the Internet Service Provider monitoring its service or affirmatively seeking facts indicating infringing activity.</p>

<p>7. Each Party shall provide procedures, whether judicial or administrative, in accordance with that Party’s legal system, and consistent with principles of due process and privacy, that enable a copyright owner that has made a legally sufficient claim of copyright infringement to obtain expeditiously from an Internet Service Provider information in the provider’s possession identifying the alleged infringer, in cases in which that information is sought for the purpose of protecting or enforcing that copyright.</p>

<p>8. The Parties understand that the failure of an Internet Service Provider to qualify for the limitations in paragraph 1(b) does not itself result in liability. Further, this Article is without prejudice to the availability of other limitations and exceptions to copyright, or any other defences under a Party’s legal system.</p>

<p>9. The Parties recognise the importance, in implementing their obligations under this Article, of taking into account the impacts on right holders and Internet Service Providers.</p>

<h2>Section K: Final Provisions</h2>

<ul>
<li>For transitions for Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) for pharmaceutical products:</li>
</ul>


<p>(A) The Parties will consider a justified request from Viet Nam for an extension of the transition period for up to two additional years. Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason for the requested extension. Viet Nam may avail itself of this one-time extension upon providing a request in accordance with this paragraph unless the Commission decides otherwise within 60 days of receiving the request. No later than the date on which the additional two-year period expires, Viet Nam shall provide to the Commission in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfill its obligation under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics).</p>

Viet Nam’s request shall include the reason for the request. The Commission shall decide pursuant to the procedures set forth in Article 27.3 (Decision-Making), whether to grant the request based on relevant factors, which may include capacity as well as other appropriate circumstances. Viet Nam shall make the request no later than one year prior to the expiration of the two-year transition period referred to in the first sentence of paragraph (A). The Parties shall give due consideration to that request. If the Committee grants Viet Nam’s request, Viet Nam shall provide to the Commission in writing a report on the measures it has taken to fulfill its obligations under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) no later than the date on which the extension period expires.</p>

<p>(C) Viet Nam’s implementation of Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) during three years after the conclusion of the extension period referred to in paragraph (A) shall not be subject to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement).</p>

<p>++ If there are unreasonable delays in Viet Nam in the initiation of the filing of marketing approval applications for new pharmaceutical products after Viet Nam implements its obligations under Article 18.50 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52 (Biologics) in connection with subparagraphs (f)(xxiii) and (f)(xxiv), Viet Nam may consider adopting measures to incentivize the timely initiation of the filing of these applications with a view to the introduction of new pharmaceutical products in its market. To that end, Viet Nam shall notify the other Parties through the Commission and consult with them on such a proposed measure. Such consultations shall begin within 30 days of a request from an interested Party, and shall provide adequate time and opportunity to resolve any concerns. In addition, any such measure shall respect legitimate commercial considerations and take into account the need for incentives for the development of new pharmaceutical products and for the expeditious marketing approval in Viet Nam of such products.</p>

<p><strong>Annex 18-A</strong></p>

<p><strong>Annex to Article 18.7.2</strong></p>

<p>1. Notwithstanding the obligations in Article 18.7.2 (International Agreements), and subject to paragraphs 2, 3 and 4 of this Annex, New Zealand shall:</p>

<p>(a) accede to the UPOV 1991 within three years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for New Zealand; or</p>

<p>(b) adopt a <em>sui generis</em> plant variety rights system that gives effect to the UPOV 1991 within three years of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for New Zealand.</p>

<p>2. Nothing in paragraph 1 shall preclude the adoption by New Zealand of measures it deems necessary to protect indigenous plant species in fulfilment of its obligations under the Treaty of Waitangi, provided that such measures are not used as a means of arbitrary or unjustified discrimination against a person of another Party.</p>

<p>3. The consistency of any measures referred to in paragraph 2 with the obligations in paragraph 1 shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement.</p>

<p>4. The interpretation of the Treaty of Waitangi, including as to the nature of the rights and obligations arising under it, shall not be subject to the dispute settlement provisions of this Agreement. Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) shall otherwise apply to this Annex. A panel established under Article 28.7 (Establishment of a Panel) may be requested to determine only whether any measure referred to in paragraph 2 is inconsistent with a Party’s rights under this Agreement.</p>

<p><strong>Annex 18-B</strong></p>

<p><strong>Chile</strong></p>

<p>1. Nothing in Article 18.50.1 or Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) or Article 18.52 (Biologics) prevents Chile from maintaining or applying the provisions of Article 91 of Chile’s Law No. 19.039 on Industrial Property, as in effect on the date of agreement in principle of this Agreement.</p>

<p>2. Notwithstanding Article 1.2 (Relation to Other Agreements), paragraph 1 is without prejudice to any Party’s rights and obligations under an international agreement in effect prior to the date of entry into force of this Agreement for Chile, including any rights and obligations under a trade agreement between Chile and another Party.</p>

<p><strong>Annex 18-C</strong></p>

<p><strong>Malaysia</strong></p>

<p>1. Malaysia may, for the purpose of granting protection as specified in Article 18.50.1 and Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52.1 (Biologics), require an applicant to commence the process of obtaining marketing approval for pharmaceutical products covered under those Articles within 18 months from the date that the product is first granted marketing approval in any country.</p>

<p>2. For greater certainty, the periods of protection referred to in Article 18.50.1 and Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data) and Article 18.52.1 (Biologics) shall begin on the date of marketing approval of the pharmaceutical product in Malaysia.</p>

<p><strong>Annex 18-D</strong></p>

<p><strong>Peru</strong></p>

<p><strong>Part 1: Applicable to Article 18.46 and Article 18.48</strong></p>

<p>To the extent that Andean Decision 486, <em>Common Industrial Property Regime</em>, and Andean Decision 689, <em>Adequacy of Certain Articles of Decision 486</em>, restricts Peru’s implementation of its obligations set forth in Article 18.46.3 (Patent Term Adjustments for Patent Office Delays) and Article 18.48.2 (Patent Term Adjustment for Unreasonable Curtailment), Peru commits to make its best efforts to obtain a waiver from the Andean Community that allows it to adjust its patent term in a way that is consistent with Article 18.46.3 and Article 18.48.2. Further, if Peru demonstrates that the Andean Community withheld its request for a waiver despite its best efforts, Peru will continue ensuring that it does not discriminate with respect to the availability or enjoyment of patent rights based on the field of technology, the place of invention, and whether products are imported or locally produced. Thus, Peru confirms that the treatment of pharmaceutical patents will be no less favourable than treatment of other patents in respect of the processing and examination of patent applications.</p>

<p><strong>Part 2: Applicable to Article 18.50 and Article 18.52</strong></p>

<p>1. If Peru relies, pursuant to Article 18.50.1(b) (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data), on a marketing approval granted by another Party, and grants approval within six months of the date of the filing of a complete application for marketing approval filed in Peru, Peru may provide that the protection specified in Article 18.50.1(b) and Article 18.52 (Biologics), as applicable, shall begin with the date of the first marketing approval relied on. In implementing Article 18.50.1(b) and Article 18.52.1(b)(i), Peru may apply the period of protection established in Article 16.10.2(b) of the <em>United States — Peru Trade Promotion Agreement</em>, done at Washington, District of Columbia, April 12, 2006.</p>

<p>2. Peru may apply paragraph 1 to Article 18.50.2 (Protection of Undisclosed Test or Other Data).</p>

<p><strong>Annex 18-E</strong></p>

<p><strong>Annex to Section J</strong></p>

<p>1. In order to facilitate the enforcement of copyright on the Internet and to avoid unwarranted market disruption in the online environment, Article 18.82.3 and Article 18.82.4(Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours) shall not apply to a Party provided that, as from the date of agreement in principle of this Agreement, it continues to:</p>

<p>(a) prescribe in its law circumstances under which Internet Service providers do not qualify for the limitations described in Article 18.82.1(b) (Legal Remedies and Safe Harbours);</p>

<p>(b) provide statutory secondary liability for copyright infringement in cases in which a person, by means of the Internet or another digital network, provides a service primarily for the purpose of enabling acts of copyright infringement, in relation to factors set out in its law, such as:</p>

<p>(i) whether the person marketed or promoted the service as one that could be used to enable acts of copyright infringement;</p>

<p>(ii) whether the person had knowledge that the service was used to enable a significant number of acts of copyright infringement;</p>

<p>(iii) whether the service has significant uses other than to enable acts of copyright infringement;</p>

<p>(iv) the person’s ability, as part of providing the service, to limit acts of copyright infringement, and any action taken by the person to do so;</p>
