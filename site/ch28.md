a) the responding Party has notified the complaining Party or Parties that it does not intend to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment; or

b) following the expiry of the reasonable period of time established in accordance with Article 28.18 (Implementation of Final Report), there is disagreement between the disputing Parties as to whether the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment;

2\. A complaining Party may suspend benefits in accordance with paragraph 2_bis_ if that complaining Party and the responding Party have:

(a) been unable to agree on compensation within 30 days after the period for developing such compensation has begun; or

(b) agreed on compensation but the relevant complaining Party considers that the responding Party has failed to observe the terms of the agreement.

_2bis_. A complaining Party may, at any time after the conditions set out in paragraph 2 are met in relation to that complaining Party, provide written notice to the responding Party that it intends to suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits of equivalent effect. The notice shall specify the level of benefits that the Party proposes to suspend. [[2]](#6782) The complaining Party may begin suspending benefits 30 days after the later of the date on which it provides notice under this paragraph or the panel issues its determination under paragraph 5, as the case may be.

3\. Compensation and the suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall be temporary measures. None of these measures is preferred to full implementation through elimination of the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment. Compensation, and suspension of benefits and the payment of a monetary assessment shall only be applied until such time as the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, or a mutually satisfactory solution is reached.

4\. In considering what benefits to suspend pursuant to paragraph 2, the complaining Party shall apply the following principles and procedures:

(a) it should first seek to suspend benefits in the same subject matter as that in which the panel has determined non-conformity or nullification or impairment to exist;

(b) if it considers that it is not practicable or effective to suspend benefits in the same subject matter and that the circumstances are serious enough, it may suspend benefits in a different subject matter. The communication pursuant to paragraph 2 in which it announces such a decision shall indicate the reasons on which it is based; and

(c) in applying the principles set out in subparagraphs (a) and (b), the complaining Party shall take into account:

(i) the trade in the good, the supply of the service or other subject matter in which the panel has found the non-conformity or nullification or impairment, and the importance of such trade to that Party;

(ii) that goods, all financial services covered under Chapter 11 (Financial Services), services other than such financial services and each section in Chapter 18 (Intellectual Property), are each distinct subject matters; and

(iii) the broader economic elements related to the nullification or impairment and the broader economic consequences of the suspension of benefits.

5\. If the responding Party considers that:

(a) the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive or the complaining Party has failed to follow the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4; or

(b) it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment that the panel has determined to exist;

it may, within 30 days after the complaining Party provides notice under paragraph 2, request that the panel be reconvened to consider the matter. The responding Party shall deliver its request in writing to the complaining Party. The panel shall reconvene as soon as possible after delivery of the request and shall present its determination to the disputing Parties within 90 days after it reconvenes to review a request under subparagraph (a) or (b), or within 120 days for a request under subparagraphs (a) and (b). If the panel determines that the level of benefits proposed to be suspended is manifestly excessive, it shall determine the level of benefits it considers to be of equivalent effect.

6\. Unless the panel has determined that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party may suspend benefits up to the level the panel has determined under paragraph 5 or, if the panel has not determined the level, the level the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2_bis_. If the panel determines that the complaining Party has not followed the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4, the panel shall set out in its award the extent to which the complaining Party may suspend benefits in which subject matter in order to ensure full compliance with the principles and procedures set out in paragraph 4\. The complaining Party may suspend benefits only in a manner consistent with the panellist’s award.

7\. The complaining Party may not suspend benefits if, within 30 days after it provides written notice of intent to suspend benefits or, if the p is reconvened under paragraph 5, within 20 days after the panel provides its determination, the responding Party provides written notice to the complaining Party that it will pay a monetary assessment. The disputing Parties shall consult, beginning no later than ten days after the responding Party, with a view to reaching agreement on the amount of the assessment. If the Parties are unable to reach an agreement within 30 days after consultations begin and are not engaged in discussions regarding the use of a fund under paragraph 8, the amount of the assessment shall be set at a level, in U.S. dollars, equal to 50 percent of the level of the benefits the panel has determined under paragraph 5 to be of equivalent effect or, if the panel has not determined the level, 50 percent of the level that the complaining Party has proposed to suspend under paragraph 2.

8\. If a monetary assessment is to be paid to the complaining Party, then it shall be paid in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties in equal, quarterly installments beginning 60 days after the responding Party gives notice that it intends to pay an assessment. Where the circumstances warrant, the disputing Parties may decide that an assessment shall be paid into a fund designated by the disputing Parties for appropriate initiatives to facilitate trade between the Parties, including by further reducing unreasonable trade barriers or by assisting carrying out its obligations under this Agreement.

9\. At the same time as the payment of its first quarterly installment, the responding Party shall provide to the complaining Party a plan of the steps it intends to take to eliminate the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

10\. A responding Party may pay a monetary assessment in lieu of suspension of benefits for a maximum of 12 months from the date on which it has provided written notice under paragraph 7 unless the complaining Party agrees to an extension.

11\. A responding Party seeking an extension shall make a written request no later than 30 days before the expiration of the 12 month period. The disputing Parties shall determine the length and terms of any extension, including the amount of the assessment.

12\. The complaining Party may suspend the application to the responding Party of benefits in accordance with paragraph 6, if:

(a) the responding Party fails to make a payment or fails to make the payment under paragraph 13 after electing to do so;

(b) the responding Party fails to provide the plan as required under paragraph 9; or

(c) the monetary assessment period, including any extension, has elapsed and the responding Party has not yet eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment.

13\. If the responding Party notified the complaining Party under paragraph 7 regarding the possible use of a fund and the disputing Parties have not agreed on the use of a fund within 3 months of the date of the responding Party’s notice, and this time period has not been extended by agreement of the disputing Parties, the responding Party may elect to make the monetary assessment payment equal to 50 per cent of the amount determined under paragraph 5\. If this election is made the payment must be made within nine months of the responding Party’s notice under paragraph 7 in U.S. currency, or in an equivalent amount of the currency of the responding Party or in another currency agreed to by the disputing Parties. If the election is not made, the complaining Party may suspend the application of benefits in the amount determined under paragraph 5 at the end of the election period.

14\. The complaining Party shall accord sympathetic consideration to the notice by the responding Party regarding the possible use of the fund referred to in paragraphs 8 and 13.

#### Article 28.20: Compliance Review

1\. Without prejudice to the procedures in Article 28.19 (Non-Implementation — Compensation and Suspension of Benefits), if the responding Party considers that it has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment found by the panel, it may refer the matter to the panel by providing written notice to the complaining Party or Parties. The panel shall issue its report on the matter within 90 days after the responding Party provides notice.

2\. If the panel decides that the responding Party has eliminated the non-conformity or the nullification or impairment, the complaining Party or Parties shall promptly reinstate any benefits suspended under Article 28.19 (Non-Implementation — Compensation and Suspension of Benefits).

## Section B: Domestic Proceedings and Private Commercial Dispute Settlement

#### Article 28.21: Private Rights

#### Article 28.22: Alternative Dispute Resolution

1\. Each Party shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage and facilitate the use of arbitration and other means of alternative dispute resolution for the settlement of international commercial disputes between private parties in the free trade area.

2\. To this end, each Party shall provide appropriate procedures to ensure observance of agreements to arbitrate and for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards in such disputes.
