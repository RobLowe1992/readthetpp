Parties recognize that under Article XI.2(a) of GATT 1994, a Party may temporarily apply an export prohibition or restriction that is otherwise prohibited under Article XI.1 of GATT 1994 on foodstuffs[[12]](#87f1) to prevent or relieve a critical shortage of foodstuffs, subject to meeting the conditions set out in Article 12.1 of the Agreement on Agriculture.

2\. Further to the conditions under which a Party may apply an export prohibition or restriction, other than a duty, tax, or other charge on food stuffs:

(a) Any Party that:

(i) imposes such a prohibition or restriction, on the exportation or sale for export of foodstuffs to another Party to prevent or relieve a critical shortage of foodstuffs, shall in all cases notify the measure to the other Parties prior to its effective date, and, except where the critical shortage is caused by an event constituting _force majeure,_ shall notify the measure to the other Parties at least 30 days prior to its effective date; or

(ii) as of the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party maintains such a prohibition or restriction, shall, within 30 days of that date, notify the measure to the other Parties.

(b) A notification under this paragraph shall include the reasons for imposing or maintaining the prohibition or restriction, as well as an explanation of how the measure is consistent with Article XI.2(a) of GATT 1994, and shall note alternative measures, if any, that the Party considered before imposing the prohibition or restriction.

(c) A measure shall not be subject to notification under this paragraph or paragraph 4 if it prohibits or restricts the exportation or sale for export only of a foodstuff or foodstuffs of which the Party imposing the measure has been a net importer during each of the three calendar years preceding imposition of the measure, excluding the year in which the Party imposes the measure.

(d) If a Party that adopts or maintains a measure referred to in subparagraph (a) has been a net importer of each foodstuff subject to that measure during each of the three calendar years preceding imposition of the measure, excluding the year in which the Party imposes the measure, and that Party does not provide the other Parties with a notification under subparagraph (a), the Party shall, within a reasonable period of time, provide to all other Parties trade data demonstrating that it was a net importer of the foodstuff or foodstuffs during these three calendar years.

3\. Any Party required to notify a measure pursuant to paragraph 2(a) shall:

(a) consult, upon request, with any other Party having a substantial interest as an importer of the foodstuffs subject to the measure, with respect to any matter related to the measure;

(b) upon the request of any Party having a substantial interest as an importer of the foodstuffs subject to the measure, provide that Party with relevant economic indicators bearing on whether a critical shortage within the meaning of Article XI.2(a) of GATT 1994 exists or is likely to occur in the absence of the measure, and on how the measure will prevent or relieve the critical shortage; and

(c) respond in writing to any question posed by any other Party regarding the measure within 14 days from receipt of the question.

4\. Any Party which considers that another Party should have notified a measure under paragraph 2(a) may bring the matter to the attention of such other Party. If the matter is not satisfactorily resolved promptly thereafter, the Party which considers that the measure should have been notified may itself bring the measure to the attention of the other Parties.

5\. A Party should ordinarily terminate a measure subject to notification under paragraphs 2(a) or 4 within 6 months of the date it is imposed. A Party contemplating continuation of a measure beyond 6 months from the date it is imposed shall so notify the other Parties no later than 5 months following the date the measure is imposed and provide the information specified in subparagraph 2(b). Unless it has consulted with all other Parties who are net importers of any foodstuff the exportation of which is prohibited or restricted under the measure, the Party shall not continue the measure beyond 12 months from the date it is imposed. The Party shall immediately discontinue the measure at such time that the critical shortage, or threat thereof, no longer exists.

6\. No Party shall apply any measure subject to notification under paragraphs 2(a) or 4 to food purchased for non-commercial humanitarian purposes.

(i) the rates of customs duties provided for in any tariff line in that Party’s Schedule in any staging category other than “EIF” shall be initially reduced on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party; and

(ii) except as otherwise provided in that Party’s Schedule, the second stage of tariff reduction shall take effect on January 1 of the following year, and each subsequent annual stage of tariff reduction shall take effect on January 1 of each subsequent year.

(b) Except as provided in paragraph 4(b)(i), when this Agreement enters into force for a Party pursuant to paragraphs 4 and 5 or Article 30.5 (Entry into Force):

(i) on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for that Party, that Party shall implement all stages of tariff reduction that it would have implemented up to that date as if this Agreement had entered into force pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2, or 3 of Article 30.5 (Entry into Force); and

4\. (a) A Party for which this Agreement has entered into force pursuant to paragraphs 1, 2, or 3 of Article 30.5 (Entry into Force) (an “original Party”) may, with respect to a Party for which the Agreement has entered into force pursuant to paragraphs 4 or 5 of Article 30.5 (a “new Party”), either:

(i) apply its Schedule to this Annex as if this Agreement had entered into force for both Parties on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the new Party; or

(ii) apply its Schedule to this Annex as if this Agreement had entered into force for both Parties on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the original Party.

(b) If the original Party applies its Schedule as if this Agreement had entered into force for both Parties on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the new Party pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(i), the new Party may apply its Schedule with respect to the original Party, either:

(i) as if this Agreement had entered into force for both Parties on the date of entry into force of the Agreement for the new Party; or

(ii) as if this Agreement had entered into force for both Parties on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for the original Party.

A signatory shall, no later than 24 days after the date of the affirmative determination by the Commission referred to in Article 30.5.5 for that signatory, notify all Parties of its election under paragraph 4(b) with respect to each original Party that notified its election to apply its Schedule pursuant to paragraph 4(a)(i) for that signatory.

(d) An original Party that does not notify an election under subparagraph (a) as provided in subparagraph (c) shall, upon entry into force of this Agreement for the new Party, apply its Schedule to the new Party as provided in subparagraph (a)(ii). A new Party that does not notify an election under subparagraph (b) as provided in subparagraph (c) shall, upon entry into force of this Agreement for that new Party, apply its Schedule to the original Party as provided in subparagraph (b)(ii).

(e) For greater certainty:

(i) an original Party that applies its Schedule to a new Party as provided in paragraph 4(a)(i) may unilaterally accelerate the elimination of customs duties on an originating good set out in its Schedule to this Annex with respect to the new Party pursuant to Article 2.4.5 (Elimination of Customs Duties); and

(ii) a new Party that applies its Schedule to an original Party as provided in paragraph 4(b)(i) may unilaterally accelerate the elimination of customs duties on an originating good set out in its Schedule to this Annex with respect to the original Party pursuant to Article 2.4.5 (Elimination of Customs Duties).

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if on the date of entry into force of this Agreement for a new Party for which an original Party has elected to apply its schedule as provided in paragraph 4(a)(i):

(i) the original Party unilaterally accelerates the elimination of customs duties on an originating good of the new Party, the original Party shall not subsequently reverse that acceleration; and

(ii) the new Party unilaterally accelerates the elimination of customs duties on an originating good of the original Party, the new Party shall not subsequently reverse that acceleration.
