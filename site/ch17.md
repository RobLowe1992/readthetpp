#### Article 17.7: Adverse Effects

1\. For the purposes of paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance), adverse effects arise where:

(a) the effect of the non-commercial assistance is that the production and sale of a good by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes from the Party’s market imports of a like good of another Party or sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party;

(b) the effect of the non-commercial assistance is that the production and sale of a good by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displaces or impedes:

(i) from the market of another Party sales of a like good produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of that other Party, or imports of a like good of another Party; or

(ii) from the market of a non-Party imports of a like good of another Party;

(c) the effect of the non-commercial assistance is a significant price undercutting by a good produced by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance and sold by the enterprise:

(i) in the market of a Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party or a like good that is produced by an enterprise that is a covered investment in the territory of the Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market; or

(ii) in the market of a non-Party as compared with the price in the same market of imports of a like good of another Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market;

(d) the effect of the non-commercial assistance is that services supplied by a Party's state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance displace or impede from the market of another Party a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or a third Party; or

(e) the effect of the non-commercial assistance is a significant price undercutting by a service supplied in the market of another Party by a Party’s state-owned enterprise that has received the non-commercial assistance as compared with the price in the same market of a like service supplied by a service supplier of that other Party or a third Party, or significant price suppression, price depression or lost sales in the same market.[[22]](#1348)

2\. For the purposes of subparagraphs (a), (b), and (d) of paragraph 1, the displacing or impeding of a good or service includes any case in which it has been demonstrated that there has been a significant change in relative shares of the market to the disadvantage of the like good or like service. “Significant change in relative shares of the market” shall include any of the following situations:

(a) there is a significant increase in the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise;

(b) the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise remains constant in circumstances in which, in the absence of the non-commercial assistance, it would have declined significantly; or

(c) the market share of the good or service of the Party’s state-owned enterprise declines, but at a significantly slower rate than would have been the case in the absence of the non-commercial assistance.

The change must manifest itself over an appropriately representative period sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for the good or service concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one year.

3\. For the purposes of subparagraphs (c) and (e) of paragraph 1, price undercutting shall include any case in which such price undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of the prices of the good or service of the state-owned enterprise with the prices of the like good or service.

4\. Comparisons of the prices in paragraph 3 shall be made at the same level of trade and at comparable times, and due account shall be taken for factors affecting price comparability. If a direct comparison of transactions is not possible, the existence of price undercutting may be demonstrated on some other reasonable basis, such as, in the case of goods, a comparison of unit values.

5\. Non-commercial assistance that a Party provides

(a) before the signingof this Agreement, or

(b) within 3years after the signingof this Agreement pursuant to a law that is enacted, or contractual obligation undertaken, prior to the signing of this Agreement

shall be deemed to not cause adverse effects.

6.For the purposes of 17.6.1(b) and 17.6.2(b), adverse effects are deemed not to arise from the initial capitalisation of a state-owned enterprise, or the acquisition by a Party of a controlling interest in an enterprise, that is principally engaged in the supply of services within the territory of the Party.

#### Article 17.8: Injury

1\. For the purposes of Article 17.6.3 (Non-Commercial Assistance), the term “injury” shall be taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material injury to a domestic industry or material retardation of the establishment of such an industry. A determination of material injury shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective examination of the relevant factors,including the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, the effect of such production on prices for like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, and the effect of such production on the domestic industry producing like goods.[[23]](#9558)

2\. With regard to the volume of production by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance, consideration shall be given as to whether there has been a significant increase in the volume of production, either in absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the territory of the Party in which injury is alleged to have occurred. With regard to the effect of the production by the covered investment on prices, consideration shall be given as towhether there has been a significant price undercutting by the goods produced and sold by the covered investment as compared with the price of like goods produced and sold by the domestic industry, or whether the effect of production by the covered investment is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance.

3\. The examination of the impact on the domestic industry of the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that received the non-commercial assistance shall include an evaluation of all relevant economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, such as actual and potential decline in output, sales, market share, profits, productivity, return on investments, or utilisation of capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an increased burden on government support programmes. This list is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive guidance.

4\. It must be demonstrated that the goods produced and sold by the covered investment are, through the effects[[24]](#c0de) of the non-commercial assistance, causing injury within the meaning of this Article. The demonstration of a causal relationship between the above mentioned goods and the injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence. Any known factors other than the goods produced by the covered investment which at the same time are injuring the domestic industry shall be examined, and the injuries caused by these other factors must not be attributed to the goods produced and sold by the covered investment that has received non-commercial assistance. Factors which may be relevant in this respect include, _inter alia_, the volumes and prices of other like goods in the market in question, contraction in demand or changes in the patterns of consumption, and developments in technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic industry.

5\. A determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. A determination of a threat of material injury shall be considered with special care.The change in circumstances which would create a situation in which non-commercial assistance to the covered investment would cause injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, there should be consideration of relevant factors[[25]](#f5d1) and of whether the totality of the factors considered lead to the conclusion that further availability of goods produced by the covered investment is imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would occur.

#### Article 17.9: Party-Specific Annexes

1\. Article 17.4 (Non-Discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations) and Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance) shall not apply with respect to the non-conforming activities of state-owned enterprises or designated monopolies that a Party lists in its Schedule to Annex IV in accordance with the terms of the Party’s Schedule.

3\. The threshold shall be adjusted for changes in general price levels using a composite SDR inflation rate, calculated as a weighted sum of cumulative percent changes in the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) deflators of SDR component currencies over the three-year period ending 30 June of the year prior to the adjustment taking effect, and using the following formula:

where,

= threshold value at base period

= new (adjusted) threshold value

= respective (fixed) weights of each currency, , in the SDR (as at 30 June of the year prior to adjustment taking effect)

= cumulative percent change in the GDP deflator of each currency, , in the SDR over the three-year period ending 30 June of the year prior to adjustment taking effect.

4\. Parties shall convert the threshold into national currency terms where the conversion rates will be the average of monthly values of each Party’s national currency in SDR terms over the three-year period to 30 June of the year before the threshold is to take effect. Each Party shall notify the other Parties of their applicable threshold in their respective national currencies.

5\. All data for the purposes of this Chapter are to be drawn from the International Monetary Fund’s _International Financial Statistics_ database.

**PROCESS FOR DEVELOPING INFORMATION CONCERNING STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES AND DESIGNATED MONOPOLIES**

1\. Where an arbitral tribunal has been established pursuant to Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) to examine a complaint arising under Article 17.4 (Non-Discriminatory Treatment and Commercial Considerations) or Article 17.6 (Non-commercial Assistance), the disputing Parties may exchange written questions, as set forth in paragraphs 2 through 4, to obtain information relevant to the complaint that is not otherwise readily available.

2\. A disputing Party (the “questioning Party”) may provide written questions to the other disputing Party (the “answering Party”) within 15 days of the date the tribunal is established. The answering Party shall provide its responses to the questions to the questioning Party within 30 days from the date it receives the questions.

3\. The questioning Party may provide any follow-up written questions to the answering Party within 15 days of the date it receives the responses to the initial questions. The answering Party shall provide its responses to the follow-up questions to the questioning Party within 30 days from the date it receives the follow-up questions.

4\. If the questioning Party considers that the answering Party has failed to cooperate in the information-gathering process, the questioning Party shall inform the tribunal and the answering Party in writing within 30 days of the date the responses to the questioning Party’s final questions are due, and provide the basis for this view. The tribunal shall afford the answering Party an opportunity to reply in writing.

5\. Each disputing Party that provides written questions or answers to the other disputing Party pursuant to these procedures shall, on the same day, provide the questions or answers to the tribunal. In the event that a tribunal has not yet been composed, each disputing Party shall, upon the composition of the tribunal, promptly provide the tribunal with any questions or responses it has provided to the other disputing Party.

6\. The answering Party may designate information in its responses as confidential information in accordance with the procedures set out in the Rules of Procedure established pursuant to Article 27.2.1(e) (Functions of the Commission) or other rules of procedure agreed to by the Parties.

7\. The time periods in paragraphs 2 through 4 may be modified upon agreement of the Parties or approval by the arbitral tribunal.

8\. In determining whether a disputing Party has failed to cooperate in the information-gathering process, the tribunal shall take into account the reasonableness of the questions and the efforts the answering Party has made to respond to the questions in a cooperative and timely manner.

9\. In making findings of fact and its initial determination, the tribunal should draw adverse inferences from instances of non-cooperation by a disputing Party in the information-gathering process.

10\. The tribunal may deviate from the time period set out in Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) for the issuance of the initial determination where necessary to accommodate the information-gathering process.

11\. The tribunal may seek additional information from a disputing Party that was not provided to the tribunal through the information-gathering process where the tribunal considers the information necessary to resolve the dispute. However, the tribunal shall not request additional information to complete the record where the information would support a Party’s position and the absence of that information in the record is the result of that Party’s non-cooperation in the information-gathering process.

<pre name="2518" id="2518">[4] For greater certainty, non-commercial assistance does not include (a) intra-group transactions within a corporate group including state-owned enterprises (e.g. between the parent and subsidiaries of the group, or among the group's subsidiaries) when normal business practices require reporting the financial position of the group excluding these intra-group transactions, (b) other transactions between state-owned enterprises that are consistent with the usual practices of privately owned enterprises in arm’s length transactions, or (c) a Party's transfer of funds, collected from contributors to a plan for pension, retirement, social security, disability, death or employee benefits, or any combination thereof, to an independent pension fund for investment on behalf of the contributors and their beneficiaries.</pre>
