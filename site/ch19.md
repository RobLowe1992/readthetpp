This Plan shall create rights and obligations only as between Viet Nam and the United States.

**I.** **Preamble**

The Governments of the Socialist Republic of Viet Nam and the United States:

**ACKNOWLEDGING** that each Party commits under Chapter 19 (Labour) to obligations concerning its labour law[[1]](#31a9) and practice, including with regard to its laws and regulations and the labour rights as stated in the ILO Declaration;

**RECOGNIZING** the importance of enforcement of and compliance with their respective law;

**UNDERTAKE** through this Plan the following commitments consistent with those obligations.

**II. Legal Reforms**

1\. Viet Nam shall enact the following legal reforms, either by amending existing laws, decrees or regulations or by issuing new laws, decrees or regulations and shall enact any additional changes required to ensure consistency across the legal code.

2\. Viet Nam shall ensure that its laws and regulations permit workers, without distinction, employed by an enterprise to form a grassroots labour union (in Vietnamese _to chuc cua nguoi lao dong_) of their own choosing without prior authorisation. To operate, a grassroots labour union shall register with its choice of either the Viet Nam General Confederation of Labour (VGCL) or the competent government body. A grassroots labour union registered with the competent government body shall have the right autonomously to elect its representatives, adopt its constitution and rules, organize its administration, including managing its finances and assets, bargain collectively, and organize and lead strikes and other collective actions related to the occupational and socio-economic interests of the workers at its enterprise. For greater certainty, a grassroots labour union registered with the competent government body shall have no lesser rights in law and practice with regard to the labour rights as stated in the ILO Declaration than a grassroots labour union under the VGCL.

**A.** **Ensure the Right of Workers to Freely Form and Join a Labour Union of Their Choosing**

1\. Viet Nam shall provide in its law and practice that workers may choose to establish grassroots labour unions through the VGCL or the competent government body, and shall establish the necessary legal procedures and registration mechanisms, through decrees or other means, for recognition of a grassroots labor union either by joining the VGCL or by registration with the competent government body. Viet Nam shall ensure that the procedures and mechanisms for registering grassroots labour unions are consistent with the labour rights as stated in the ILO Declaration, including with respect to transparency, the time periods for processing and membership requirements, and without prior authorisation or discretion.

3\. Viet Nam shall ensure in its law and practice that:

(a) workers and labour unions registered with the competent government body may request and receive technical assistance and training from any Vietnamese or international worker organization legally operating in Viet Nam; and

5\. Viet Nam shall ensure that its law does not require that an upper-level labour union assist a grassroots labour union in its functions and does specify that an upper-level labour union may do so only on the specific request of a grassroots labour union. Relevant articles in current law include Labor Code (LC) Article 188(1) and Article 188(2).

**C.** **Worker representation in non-unionized workplaces**

Viet Nam shall ensure that its law does not require that an upper-level labour union represent non-unionized workers and does provide that an upper-level labour union can represent non-unionized workers only upon the request of those non-unionized workers and only with respect to that worker or those workers who have specifically requested such assistance. Relevant articles in current law include LC Article 188(3) and Article 210(2).

**F.** **Consistency of other laws**

Viet Nam shall ensure that no laws or legal instruments, or provisions therein, such as the law on association, are applied or amended in a manner to undermine labour union-related activity, including organizing labour unions, collective bargaining and strikes, or assisting with those activities, as provided in the LC, TUL and other Vietnamese labour-related laws.

The United States and Viet Nam shall regularly assess progress in implementing this Plan, including follow-up enforcement and application of the amended laws, decrees and regulations and institutional reforms, and, to this end, agree to the following actions:

**A.** **Government-to-Government Mechanisms**

_Senior Officials Committee_

1\. The United States and Viet Nam hereby establish a standing bilateral Senior Officials Committee (SOC) composed of senior officials from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and the Department of Labor for the United States and from the Ministry of Industry and Trade and the Ministry of Labor, Invalids, and Social Affairs for Viet Nam to monitor, assess, and facilitate rapid response to any concerns about compliance with and implementation of the legal and institutional reforms under this Plan. The United States and Viet Nam shall designate the responsible senior officials prior to entry into force of the TPP Agreement for the United States and Viet Nam and promptly inform the other Party of any subsequent changes. The SOC shall meet, in person or by any technological means available, annually for 10 years after entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam. SOC members shall be supported by technical-level officials, who shall meet semi-annually for 10 years. At the request of either Viet Nam or the United States, the SOC shall continue to meet annually thereafter or as Viet Nam and the United States otherwise agree. The SOC shall discuss and consider any reports or recommendations by the Technical Assistance Program (TAP) and the Labor Expert Committee (LEC) established below. At the request of either Viet Nam or the United States, the SOC shall convene within 30 days to determine action necessary to address any concerns with regard to compliance with or implementation of the legal and institutional reforms under this Plan. Viet Nam and the United States together may request an ILO review and report on any such concern, in order to inform the discussions of the SOC and determinations of any actions necessary to address those concerns.

_Bilateral Review_

2\. The United States and Viet Nam at the Ministerial level or their designees shall, in the third, fifth, and tenth year after entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam, review and assess the implementation of this Plan, including the implementation of the legal and institutional reforms thereunder, in light of the obligations contained in Chapter 19 (Labour). In undertaking those reviews, the United States and Viet Nam shall consider the input of the SOC. If at the end of a review the United States continues to have concerns about Viet Nam’s compliance, the United States and Viet Nam shall consider taking appropriate action under the TPP Agreement.

**B.** **Supporting Mechanisms**

1\. To support the governmental review mechanisms established above, the United States and Viet Nam agree to the following actions.

_Technical Assistance Program_

2\. Viet Nam, with support from the United States, shall seek the establishment of a Technical Assistance Program (TAP) by the ILO in Viet Nam to provide continuous and regular support to Viet Nam to facilitate the implementation of the legal and institutional reforms described in this Plan. The TAP shall produce a public report two years after entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam and bi-annually thereafter for eight years containing information and data relevant to assessing such implementation, including on industrial relations practices in Viet Nam. The report may provide recommendations for improvement in implementation. Viet Nam shall take into account the recommendations of the TAP.

_Labour Expert Committee_

3\. The United States and Viet Nam hereby establish a Labor Expert Committee (LEC) comprising three members. The United States and Viet Nam shall agree on the Chair, who may be a representative of the ILO or other individual with expertise in international labour standards who shall be unbiased, objective and independent of either Party, within 30 days after entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam. The United States and Viet Nam shall each appoint one member not affiliated with or taking instructions from either government, who shall have expertise in international labour standards, within 60 days after entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam. The LEC shall produce a public report providing a factual review, including information and data on matters in Sections II, III, and IV, including subsection B.3, of this Plan relevant to Viet Nam’s application and implementation of the legal and institutional reforms under this Plan, including any challenges or concerns. The reports shall be produced at two and one-half years, four and one-half years, six and one-half years, and eight and one-half years after entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam. In its reports, the LEC also shall provide recommendations that are relevant to any identified concerns related to Viet Nam’s implementation of the legal and institutional reforms under this Plan. After such time, these reviews and reports shall continue at five-year intervals at the request of Viet Nam or the United States. The LEC shall consider the TAP reports and recommendations, including whether Viet Nam has implemented its recommendations, in its reviews. The LEC may request information from Viet Nam to ensure the timely development of its reports. Viet Nam shall cooperate with the LEC and provide any requested information to the extent practicable. The LEC shall solicit and consider the views of interested persons in the United States and Viet Nam, and consider information from any relevant public submissions made pursuant to Article 19.9 (Public Submissions).

**VI.** **Technical Assistance**

Viet Nam and the United States shall endeavor to secure funding for technical assistance programming to directly facilitate implementation of the legal and institutional reforms in this Plan. Viet Nam shall request the cooperation, advice, and technical assistance of the ILO to help in such implementation and endeavor to conclude the negotiation of an agreement with the ILO for this purpose. Viet Nam shall implement recommendations provided by the ILO as the result of this assistance. Viet Nam and the United States shall endeavor to work with other interested TPP Parties to support technical assistance programs relevant to implementation of the legal and institutional reforms in this Plan.

**VII. Implementation**

1\. Viet Nam shall enact the legal and institutional reforms in Sections II and III of this Plan prior to the date of entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam, except as otherwise noted in this Plan.

2\. Viet Nam shall comply with paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan no later than five years from the date of entry into force of the TPP Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam.

3\. This Plan shall be subject to consultations under Article 19.15 (Labour Consultations) of the Labour Chapter, except that with respect to paragraphs 2 and 3, the requirement to circulate the request and reply, respectively, to the other TPP Parties, shall not apply; and paragraph 4 shall not apply.

4\. This Plan shall be subject to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement) of the TPP Agreement, except for Article 28.13 (Third Party Participation), which shall not apply.

5\. Chapter 29 (General Exceptions) also shall apply to this Plan.

**VIII. Review of Implementation**

1\. The United States shall review the operation of paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan after the fifth anniversary of the date of entry into force of this Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam.

2\. If, following the review in paragraph 1 of this Section and before the seventh anniversary of the date of entry into force of this Agreement between the United States and Viet Nam, the United States considers that Viet Nam has failed to comply with paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan, the United States shall notify Viet Nam, in writing, of its determination. Viet Nam may, within 30 days after the date of the delivery of the notice, request, in writing, a meeting to discuss the matter.

3\. The United States shall agree to meet with Vietnam to discuss the matter within 30 days of the receipt of Viet Nam’s request. If Viet Nam does not make a request under paragraph 2 of this Section or, if the United States and Viet Nam do not agree that Viet Nam has complied with paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan within 60 days after the date of the receipt of a request under paragraph 2 of this Section, the United States may withhold or suspend any tariff reductions that are scheduled to come into effect thereafter.

4\. If the United States withholds or suspends any tariff reductions under Paragraph 3 of this Section and Viet Nam considers that it is in compliance with paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan, Viet Nam may have recourse to dispute settlement under Chapter 28 (Dispute Settlement), except as otherwise specified in this Plan. Further, for purposes of this paragraph, Viet Nam’s request for the establishment of a panel under Article 28.7 shall be limited to the matter of whether Viet Nam has complied with paragraph II.A.2.

5\. If in its final report the panel determines that Viet Nam is in compliance with paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan, the United States shall promptly apply the rate of duty set out in the U.S. schedule that would have applied had the United States not taken action under Paragraph 3 of this Section.

6\. If the United States withholds or suspends any tariff reductions under Paragraph 3 of this Section and thereafter the United States and Viet Nam agree that Viet Nam has complied with paragraph II.A.2 of this Plan, the United States shall promptly apply the rate of duty set out in the U.S. schedule that would have applied had the United States not taken action under Paragraph 3 of this Section.
