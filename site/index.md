### **You may have heard of the TPP...**

...but do you know
what's in it? Right now, the Obama administration and giant corporations are
spreading misinformation about the Trans-Pacific Partnership and
how it will affect Americans. But if you read it,
you'll see that the TPP threatens to corrupt our democracy by giving
corporations control over the government.

This site is a public resource created by
[Fight for the Future](https://www.fightforthefuture.org), the
[Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://www.eff.org), and
[Public Citizen](https://www.citizen.org). We are publishing the full text of
the TPP along with expert annotations explaining how it could actually affect
you.
